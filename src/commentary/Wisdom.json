This is why sinners are commanded to believe, because by believing one purges himself from sins. Sinners, in fact, have no idea what they will see by living rightly. This is why—since they cannot see unless they live rightly, and they cannot live rightly unless they believe—it is obvious that they must begin by believing. In this way the commandments, by which those who believe separate themselves from the things of this world, purify their hearts—for only with a pure heart can one see God. “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.” Also, in the words of the prophecy it is sung, “Seek him in sincerity of heart.”\n"

And if they are not equal, they will inevitably be loved in an unequal way. It is therefore not possible to prepare a single dwelling for them in a simple heart if they are not equal. Yet Scripture admonishes us to do so, saying, “Think of the Lord with uprightness, and seek him with simplicity of heart.” How can one seek God with simplicity of heart if he makes a distinction in his love for God the Father and God the Son? Or how can one have a simple love for God if he is convinced that there is a diversity in the Divinity? One loves with a simple heart that Divinity whose nature he believes to be simple.

In my view, the same can also be said of Christ when he was visible in the body. Not all those who laid eyes on him were able to see him.They saw the body of Christ, but they did not see Christ as Christ. His disciples, however, saw him and contemplated the greatness of his divinity. I think this is the reason why, when Philip asks him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us,” the Savior responds, “Have I been with you all this time and you do not know me? Philip, he who sees me sees the Father as well.” In fact, neither Pilate nor Judas the betrayer gazed on the Father, for while they were gazing at Jesus, neither Pilate nor Judas gazed on Christ as Christ. Nor did the crowd that pressed around him. Only those whom Jesus deemed worthy of beholding him actually saw him. We too, therefore, should work in such a way that God might appear to us in the present (as the sacred words of Scripture promised, “He lets those find him who do not test him, and he appears to those who believe in him”). And, in the life to come, he may not be hidden from us. Rather, may we see him “face to face.”\n"

Consequently, this coming of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit does not demonstrate the mobility of God but his piety.

But this does not mean a local absence, when he justly abandons one who is unworthy; nor does he make himself present in a place if he visits with his mercy one whom he has made worthy. Therefore, even though God says, “I fill heaven and earth,” of some it is said, “God is not with them.” And though the Father fills all things, the book of Wisdom says, “Perverse thoughts separate human beings from God.” And if it also says of the Son—that is, of the wisdom of God, “she reaches from end to end with power and orders all things well,” the same Wisdom says of itself, “The perverse will seek me, but they will not find me.” And again, “Wisdom does not enter a soul who does evil or dwell in a body enslaved to sin.” And of the Holy Spirit, of whom it is said that he is immense in every way, it is said, “The Holy Spirit flees from deceit and departs from foolish speech.”\n"

Because he does not know how to sin, he is life, and he certainly cannot die, given that death is a result of sin. It is for this reason that the sinner harms himself, but not the Spirit whom he has received. The Spirit certainly cannot be affected—he whose purpose it is to justify. Thus, the sign of a person’s justification consists in this: that through the one who lives in him, the justified one shows himself to be a child of God. In fact “not in a false person or in a body enslaved to sin” can the Holy Spirit live, as Solomon says. Certainly, if one returns to a carnal life, abandoned by the Holy Spirit, he will die in his unrighteousness.\n"

We will now consider in what way both angels and human beings have been separated from God, in order to enable us to grasp without a shadow of doubt that the Trinity is inseparable. For holy Scripture says, in fact, that “perverse thoughts separate people from God,” and that “wisdom does not enter into a malignant spirit, nor does it dwell in a body given over to sin” and that “the Holy Spirit of discipline flees from deceit and distances himself from thoughts lacking in reason.” In effect, Isaiah also proves that iniquities dig a trench between God and humanity.

A person might not lie in his heart, however, if in saying something that is not in his heart, he does so knowing that what he does is evil, but he does so to avoid a greater evil—at the same time disapproving of both evils. Those who hold this principle say that Scripture, as well, must be understood in this sense when it says, “He who pronounces the truth in his heart.” With the heart, in fact, one must always speak the truth—but not always with the lips; for example, if someone is forced, so as to avoid a greater evil, to say with his voice something contrary to what is in his mind.… A response in fact cannot be known when it remains hidden from others, who cannot listen to the voice of the heart unless the voice of the body makes it heard. But that voice of the heart does reach the ears of the Spirit of the Lord who, as Scripture says in the text cited, fills the whole earth. In that same portion of Scripture it also speaks about lips, the voice and language; but saying that these are known to the Lord means nothing other than what refers to the heart. Thus, when it is said that a sound “reaches our ears,” it means that it is no longer hidden even from human beings.\n"

Also, regarding the text, “The Spirit of the Lord fills the universe,” there are those who understand by this that spirit which, as an invisible creature, encompasses and vivifies the entire visible creation with a universal breath. But even here I do not see what would prevent one from understanding the Holy Spirit, when God says in a prophet, “I fill the heavens and the earth.” God in fact does not fill heaven and earth without his Holy Spirit. What is strange, then, if it was said of his Holy Spirit, “he filled the universe”? Indeed, he fills in one way when he sanctifies, as was said of Stephen, “He was filled with the Holy Spirit,” and of many others. In another way he fills with sanctifying grace, as happens with some saints, and in yet another way he fills everything with his manifest and ordering presence. In conclusion, I do not know whether it can be proven with certainty from Scripture that, when speaking of the Spirit of God or of the Spirit of the Lord without any further qualification, it refers to something other than the Holy Spirit.\n"

Indeed, the apostle says, “Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. In fact, the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.” In the same letter, the apostle asserts that we are the temple of God in such a way as to say that we are also the temple of the Holy Spirit. He says, “Do you not know that your members are the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God?” And precisely to show that the Holy Spirit is God, he adds, “Glorify and keep God in your hearts.”\n"

It follows that, if the Jews had wanted to kill Christ but were unable to carry out their intention (and therefore actually would not have killed him), they would have still been guilty, while you would have been without the advantages of the passion of Christ. The godless therefore wanted to carry out actions worthy of condemnation and were allowed to do so in your favor.

In fact, the Almighty, who was capable of forming human nature, can also reform and preserve it, healing its fragility through grace.\n"

Who can forgive sins, but God alone?’ But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, responded, ‘What are you thinking in your hearts?’ ” Whereas Luke said, “the scribes and the Pharisees began to ask themselves,” Matthew says, “Then some scribes began to think, ‘This man blasphemes!’ But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, ‘Why do you think evil things in your hearts?’ ” The book of Wisdom also says of some, “They spoke among themselves, reasoning unsoundly.” It is therefore clear that to think is the same as to speak within oneself.

It seemed that he wanted to render true and actually present what had been said through the words of the prophet, “Let us bind the righteous one, because he is useless to us.” And in fact Christ truly was useless to the Jews, not because he really was useless but because, lovers of sin and pleasure that they were, it seemed that he brought them nothing good. Rather, he brought a righteousness that exceeded the Law, clearly explaining what was pleasing to God, who loves virtue. The Law offered no such way, only indicating through shadows and darkness, indirectly and with difficulty, what might be of benefit to its hearers. Thus, as sunlight is in a certain way useless for one with a disease of the eyes, and he receives no benefit because his illness prevents it; and as healthy food seems more useless to sick people than to others, though by it they would recover the health they desire; so also the Lord seemed useless to the Jews, though he was the author of salvation.

Come, let us kill him, and see what becomes of his dreams.” The godless, as Solomon says, said about our Joseph, “Come, let us kill the righteous one, because he is displeasing to us.” And they continue, “He claims to possess knowledge of God and declares himself a son of God. Let’s see if his words are true, and let’s find out what will happen in the end.” He confirms what is in the Gospel, when he says about the son sent to the vineyard workers, “This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.” After seizing Joseph, the brothers stripped him of his many-colored tunic and threw him in a ditch. Our Joseph, by the mouth of the prophet, says the same of his passion: “They threw me in the outer ditch, in darkness and the shadow of death.” By the Gospel’s authority we are told how he was stripped of his tunic, which was woven from top to bottom and which the soldiers refused to divide among themselves, thus confirming the unity of the church. Heretics are excluded from this casting of lots, because it was to be that only one would possess it, that is, unity. “Taking,” Scripture says, “a kid from the goats, Joseph’s brothers dipped the tunic in its blood” and took it to their father, falsely saying that a wild beast had torn him to pieces.\n"

He will not understand what death is when he sees the wise die. In fact, he says to himself, hasn’t the one who was so wise, who was intimate with Wisdom, who worshiped God with such piety—hasn’t he died also? I will therefore do what I like while I live. Indeed, if those who have wisdom could do something about it, they would not die. He sees the one who dies, yet fails to see what death is. “When he sees the death of the wise, he will not see death.” In the same way, the Jews saw Christ hanging on the cross and mocked him, saying, “If he is the Son of God, he would come down from the cross.” They did not see, in short, what death is. O, if they had seen what death is, they would have understood it! He died in time, so as to live again forever. They lived in time, so as to die forever. But since they saw him die, they did not see death, that is, they did not understand what true death is. What, in fact, do they say in Wisdom? “Let us condemn him to a shameful death, because, according to his own words, he will be protected. If he is truly a son of God, God will help him, and free him from the hands of his adversaries.” That is, he will not allow his Son to die, if he truly is his Son. But when they saw him on the cross being insulted, and he did not descend from the cross, they said, “He was truly a man.” It had already been said that one who could rise from the grave certainly could have descended from the cross. He taught us, however, to bear insults, to be patient before the tongues of people, to drink the bitter chalice44 now so as to later receive eternal life. You who are sick, drink the bitter chalice if you want to be healthy, because now your viscera are not healthy. Do not tremble with fear, because the doctor drank it first, that you might not tremble. The Lord, that is, drank the bitterness of the passion first. The one who had no sin drank, the one who had nothing to be healed of. Drink, therefore, until the bitterness of this world passes, until that world comes where there will be no scandal, no anger, no sickness, no bitterness, no fever, no deceit, no enmity, no old age, no death, no quarrels.\n"

Do you know why he was glorified? He said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son, so that your Son may glorify you.” For him, therefore, even the passion of the cross was glory. This glory was not glorious, however, but humble. Finally, it is said of him, “He humbled himself even to death, death on a cross,” and of this also the prophet had foretold, “Let us condemn him to a shameful death.” But Isaiah also says of him, “He bore his judgment in humiliation.” Thus in all these events the Lord was glorified, but humbly, so to speak.

Thus, insulting him as he hung on the cross, they shook their heads, saying, “If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross. He saved others, but he cannot save himself.” With these words, as one reads in the book of Wisdom, “they thought thus but were mistaken. Their wickedness blinded them.” What would have been so amazing about coming down from the cross, for one who rose from the grave without difficulty? But why did he want to be patient to death? To flee from the presence of Saul into the cave. “Cave,” here, can be understood as a lower part of the earth. It was attested, in fact, and known to all, that Jesus’ body was placed in a grave that had been hewn out of rock. This grave, then, was the cave, and Christ took refuge there from Saul. The Jews, in fact, persecuted him until he was placed in the cave. How can we show that they persecuted him until he had been put in the cave? They wounded him with a lance, when he was already dead on the cross. But when, after the funeral practices, the corpse was wrapped in linen and placed in the cave, by then they had nothing to do with his flesh. It was then that the Lord arose, unharmed and incorrupt, from the cave where he had taken refuge to flee the presence of Saul. He hid himself from the godless, whom Saul prefigured, and showed himself to his members. Once risen, his bodily members were touched by his members, the apostles. They touched the risen one and believed. Thus, Saul’s persecution came to nothing.\n"

The Jews did see a lamp in each of the prophets, but they did not recognize the Sun of righteousness13 that arose. Therefore, even though it seemed that they had a lamp, this was taken from them.

And it came to pass, while they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.\" [Genesis 4:3-8] You see, brethren, how envy and jealousy led to the murder of a brother. Through envy, also, our father Jacob fled from the face of Esau his brother [Genesis 27:41-45]. Envy made Joseph be persecuted unto death, and to come into bondage. [Genesis 37:18-28] Envy compelled Moses to flee from the face of Pharaoh king of Egypt, when he heard these words from his fellow-countryman, \"Who made you a judge or a ruler over us? Will you kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?\" [Exodus 2:14] On account of envy, Aaron and Miriam had to make their abode without the camp. [Numbers 12:14-15] Envy brought down Dathan and Abiram alive to Hades, through the sedition which they excited against God's servant Moses. [Numbers 16:33] Through envy, David not only underwent the hatred of foreigners, but was also persecuted by Saul king of Israel. [1 Samuel 21:10-15]\n"

For those, then, who did not know what they were doing, “I have become like a man without support,” when I was “free among the dead.” And for those who did not know what they were doing, I have become “like the slain who sleep in the grave. And they are cast away from your hand.” That is, when they reduced me to such a condition, “they were cast away from your hand.” They thought I was a man without support; rather, it was they who were without the support of your hand. In fact, as it says in another psalm, “they dug a ditch before me, but they fell in it themselves.” I think that the words “and I have been cast away from your hand” are best interpreted in this way, rather than referring to those who sleep in the grave, whom God does not remember. In fact, there are some righteous people among these latter, of whom it is true that he has not remembered them yet, so as to raise them. Nevertheless, of these it is also said, “The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God.” That is, they enjoy the support of the Most High, and they dwell in the protection of the God of heaven. As for the others, however, they were cast away from the hand of God, since they thought that the Lord Jesus Christ was rejected by his hand, so much so that they could number him among the evildoers and kill him.\n"

At the same time by indirect suggestion and general discussion he prepares the reader for the fact that the dream Nebuchadnezzar saw was concerned with the change and succession of empires. \"He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who acquire learning.\" This accords with the scripture: \"The wise man will hear and increase his wisdom\" (Proverbs 1:5). \"For he who has, to him it shall be given\" (Matthew 25:29).

The others die and truly perish, because what awaits them when they depart from this world is the torment and punishment of a terrible judgment. The good are called before their time, so that the perverse will torment them no more. The wicked and godless are taken away so that they would no longer persecute the good. The righteous are called from difficulties, tribulations and anguish into rest. The godless are dragged from luxury, abundance and pleasures to punishment. The former go to judge, the latter to be judged. The former, to receive their due, the latter to receive their punishment, as it is written, “The righteous, even if he dies prematurely, will find rest.” And also, “Because he lived among sinners, he was taken away.” And also, “His soul was pleasing to the Lord. Therefore God took him quickly from the wickedness around him.” And still, “They go to death together with the godless, but they are in peace.” You see therefore that this disintegration of the body is rest, not punishment, for the righteous and for those who worship God. In decay, rather than perishing, they are freed. Thus the faithful do not fear decay, nor are they overawed by it, but they desire and long for its coming. They understand that through it they will arrive at rest, not punishment. The perverse, the godless and those who are conscious of their crimes rightly fear decay, because of a natural disposition by which they cannot fail to judge themselves. Consequently, having received and understood this explanation, we must not sin at all, especially because we are not unaware that there is a judgment of sinners in this world, which remains in the future one.\n"

In you there is no old age or the misery of old age. In you there are no cripples, or lame, or hunchbacks or deformed, but all “arrive at the stature of the perfect person, to the measure of the full maturity of Christ.” What can be more beautiful than this life in which there is no fear of poverty or the sadness of disability; where no one is hurt or angry or envious; where no concupiscence flares up, nor is there desire for food, and where we are not agitated by ambition for honor or power? There is no fear of the devil there or of the snares of demons, and the fear of hell is long gone. There is death neither of the body nor of the soul but a life made joyous by the gift of immortality. There will be no more discord; rather, everything will be harmonious, of one heart, because there will be one unanimity among all the saints. Everything will be peaceful and joyful, calm and serene. There will be a perpetual splendor, not the one we see now but a greater brightness to match the greater happiness. Therefore, as we read, that “city will have no need of the light of the sun,” but the almighty Lord will enlighten it, “and its lamp is the Lamb,” where the saints will shine like stars forever, and those who teach many, like the splendor of the firmament. Thus, there will never be night or any darkness. Clouds will not gather, nor will there be cold or heat or bitterness. Rather, everything will be such that “eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man,” except those found worthy to enjoy it, “whose names are written in the book of life.”\n"

Who would not fall trembling to the ground? Who would not hasten to penitence with a humble spirit, before the end of this present life? The apostle cries out, “If someone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him,” and the vain person seduces himself with an extremely perverse thought, saying, “Even if I violate God’s temple and live badly until the end, I will be saved.” Is not the apostle speaking of such people when he says, “Let us do evil that good may result (and their condemnation is just)”84? It is not these that sacred Scripture calls unhappy and their hope completely vain when it says, “The one who disdains wisdom and discipline is unhappy. Their hope is vain, and their labor without fruit.” Salvation will not be given, therefore, to the wicked but to the righteous, that is, to those who have corrected themselves and converted before the end of this life. Salvation will be given to the good who, by conversion, have pursued friendship with God. It will not be given to the bad who, remaining friends of the world, rightly deserve to be called enemies of God, in the words of the apostle’s reproach. Blessed James in fact rebukes them, saying, “Adulterers, do you not know that friendship with this world is enmity with God? If, therefore, one wants to be a friend of this world, he makes himself an enemy of God.”\n"

It is clear that this can also be understood regarding teachers of heretical doctrines, who glory in the great numbers of children whom they have raised to perdition, drawing them out of the church and leading them on to homicide. Indeed, as many children as the heretics have generated in error, the devil has butchered. Of such a soul it is said, “Blessed is the barren woman who is undefiled, who has not known a sinful bed.” And, in fact, blessed is the person of the church who, as opposed to the heretic, has not generated children in error.

I did not ask for the death of my enemy but the life of my son. What evil is there in that? You asked for nothing evil, in your opinion. But what would you say if he was taken so that wickedness would not corrupt his soul? But, you object, he was a sinner! And this is why I wanted him to live, so that he would amend his life. You wanted him to live so that he would become better. And what would you say if someone told you that God knew that he would have become worse if he had lived? How do you know which would have been better for him, to die or to live? If, then, you do not know, return to your heart, and leave every decision to God. You will say to me, “But, then, what should I do? What should I ask for in prayer?” What should you ask for? What the Lord, the heavenly teacher, taught us. Invoke God as God, love God as God.

We are sad in a human way, therefore, for a man’s departure. But as we heard in the divine lesson, “In a short time, he fulfilled a long career.” But, then, let us count those times as one counts a day. All that he did among you, exhorting, speaking, offering himself for your imitation—preserve it so as to praise and adore God, and you will be his most splendid memorial. Indeed, what matters for him is not that he be hidden in a marble tomb but that he be built up in your hearts—that he who has been buried would live in living sepulchers.

Generation according to the Spirit, by contrast, takes place completely invisibly. We see one who is baptized descend into the font, be immersed in the water and come out again, but we do not in any way see what effect the bath of regeneration has had. Only the piety of the faithful knows that he descends into the water a sinner but comes out purified; he descends a child of death but comes out a child of the resurrection; he descends a child of transgression but comes out a child of reconciliation; he descends a child of wrath but comes out a child of mercy; he descends a child of the devil but comes out a child of God. Only Mother Church, who generates him, knows this, but to the eyes of the foolish it seems that he comes out of the font just as he went in, and the whole thing is just a game. Consequently, at the end, seeing the glory of the saints, groaning in torment they will say, “Here are the ones whom we once derided and who were the target of our insults. How is it that they are numbered among the children of God?” And the apostle John says, “Beloved, now we are the children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we will be.” In fact, what is born of the Spirit is Spirit, because the one who is regenerated by water and the Spirit25 is invisibly changed into a new person, and from being carnal he becomes spiritual. And he is rightly called not only spiritual but even spirit, because as the essence of the spirit is invisible to our senses, likewise one who is renewed by the grace of God, in a way invisible to our eyes, becomes spiritual and a child of God, though he seems to all to be visibly flesh and a child of human beings.\n"

Many objects have been chosen by the inspired authors to represent the saints, but no one worships them. If in fact you wanted to worship everything symbolizing the saints, you would have to worship the mountains and the hills, given that it is written, “The mountains will exult like rams and the hills like lambs.” You refer to the saints, but I will speak of Christ himself. If it is written, “The lion of the tribe of Judah has triumphed,” why don’t you worship the lion? And the rock as well, since it is written, “And the rock was Christ.” If, then, you do not worship these earthly beings that symbolize Christ, even if certain images have been derived from them, you must remember that any creature that has been used to symbolize the saints is just an image and reserve your adoration for the Creator. Our Lord Jesus Christ has been called the sun. But is he perhaps this sun that the least significant animals see along with us? He is the light of which it is written, “He was the true light who enlightens every person who comes into this world.” Material light enlightens not only people but also quadrupeds, herds and every kind of animal.

He in fact sits at the right hand of the Father, reigning forever in glory. By “sun” is certainly meant the Word of the Father, the Son of God, who is God made man. Christ is one, out of two: two distinct natures, each perfect. Indeed, of him the godless will say, “For us the sun has not risen, and the light of righteousness did not shine on us.” Then, “And before the moon, from age to age,” and by this must also be understood what was said earlier, “He will remain.” Christ in fact remains before the moon, which is to say before the church, which perceives him at all times thanks to the lights of the heart. Rightly the moon can be compared with the church, which does not have a splendor of its own but in some way receives the light of the sun. Astronomers accurately explain this, among other things.\n"

Indeed, it is written, “The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood.” I would call old, one who partakes in human crimes, who does not flee adultery, who does not refrain from homicide and, while no person wants to be mixed up in it when a crime comes to light, he alone is always involved. Since it is obvious that this is old, we do not find a new one other than Christ the Lord, of whom it is written, “The Sun of righteousness will rise for us.” The prophet also speaks of him, impersonating sinners, “The light of righteousness did not shine for us, nor did the sun ever rise for us.” In fact, when the entire world was oppressed by the darkness of the devil and a haze, full of crimes, covered the world, this Sun deigned in the last days, when the night was almost here, to bring about the dawn of his birth. Beforehand—before the light, before the Sun of righteousness would shine—he sent an oracle of the prophets, like an announcement of the morning, as it is written, “I sent my prophets before the light.” Then he himself shone with his rays, through the brightness of his apostles, bathing the world with a light of truth so great that no one would fall in the darkness of the devil. This is the new sun that penetrates closed places, reveals what is most intimate, searches hearts. This is the new sun that by its spirit gives life to the dead, restores the corrupt and raises what is already lost. By its warmth, it cleans what is filthy, strengthens what is weak, burns what is vicious.\n"

In fact, the sin of those things is brought with him, even if all of that for which the sins were committed is left here. Consequently, now one can boast in what he has received, exalt himself over others, be proud of having what his neighbor does not have. A time will come when he will wake up, and then he will know how empty were the things he had while he was dreaming. It often happens that someone who is poor sleeps and dreams of being rich and of thus gaining a courageous soul, rejoicing over having what he did not have and seeking to despise those by whom he had the pain of being despised. But, suddenly waking, he bemoans the image of the riches he had while he slept. Indeed, he groans continually under the weight of poverty, oppressed by the anguish of his straits and, even worse, of having been rich for a brief and useless moment. The rich of this world, who boast of what they have received, are just like this. They are incapable of doing good with their abundance. The rich are like those who sleep, but it would be good for them to awake to their poverty, because they will take nothing with them to that lasting judgment. And the higher they are exalted now, for a brief time, the more bitterly they will weep over themselves for eternity. And, according to the testimony of Wisdom, they will say at their damnation, “What has our arrogance profited us? And what good has our boasted wealth brought us? All this has passed like a shadow, like a fleeting rumor.” When they are already lost, they will know that the things they had were contemptible and fleeting, though when present, they seemed so great and permanent to their foolish hearts. The rich person opens his eyes too late, seeing Lazarus at rest, whom he had despised lying at his door. Then he will understand what he did not want to do, and what he lost, when he did not recognize his neighbor in the poor man. In fact, when the body sleeps in death, the soul awakens to true knowledge, and when the flesh dies, the soul is forced to see all that it had disdained to foresee. Then it will see happen what it feared, and the one who rejoiced to have a greater abundance of things than everyone else will find himself empty.\n"

And a little child will guide them.” And David says, “See, the kings of the earth have assembled and joined together. They saw and were amazed.” And again he says, “Who is like the Lord our God, who lives on high and looks down on earthly things? Who raises the indigent from the earth and lifts the poor from the dust, to make them sit with princes, with the princes of his people?” And also Solomon says, “He has made the small and the great, and he cares for all alike.” And he says further, “Wisdom has built her house, with seven pillars as its foundation. She has sacrificed her victims, prepared her wine in its cup and spread her table. She has sent out her servants, calling out and saying, ‘Come, eat my bread and drink the wine that I have prepared for you.’ ” The Lord confirms this in the Gospel, with the parable of the banquet prepared by the powerful rich man for his son. “He sent his servants to tell those who had been invited to come, and they excused themselves. One said, ‘I have bought a field and I am going to see it, please excuse me.’ Another said, ‘I have bought five pairs of oxen.’ And another, ‘I have just taken a wife.’ ” In these three excuses we have “the concupiscence of the flesh, the concupiscence of the eyes and worldly show,” which detained the Jews and kept them from coming to Christ’s table, to which they had been invited. “Go,” says the father, “into the plazas and the streets and bring to me those whom you find.” The pagans were thus brought in. “There is still room,” says the servant. The father responds, “Go along the hedgerows and the byways, and force those you find to come in.” Among these are the rich, kings and certain heretics who have left the Lord’s flock, who are constrained to come by him who says, “No one can come to me if the Father who sent me does not draw him.” And to those who come he says, “Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day.” The apostle Paul shows who these are when he says, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, nor slave nor free person, nor man nor woman. All of you, in fact, are one person in Christ Jesus.” The verses of the Sibyl, which we cited above, confirm this: “I will lower the hills and raise the valleys from their depths. There will no longer be anything sublime or exalted among what is human.” Maro, in agreement with the Sibyl, says, “Nor will the herds fear the great lions.”\n"

And it is precisely in virtue of this impetus that every creature is set in motion—when the angels carry out God’s orders, when the stars complete their orbit; when the winds blow now in one direction, now in another, when the abyss is stirred up by rushing waters and by condensed, swirling vapors in the air; when the vegetable kingdom germinates and its seeds develop, when animals are born and pass their lives according to their proper instincts; and when the wicked are allowed to torment the righteous. Thus God unfurls the ages that he had rolled up, so to speak, in the primordial creation. Those ages would not have followed their course if he who created them were to cease his providential government over them. The beings that grow and are born in time should teach us how we are to think of these things. Not without reason, in fact, does Scripture say that Wisdom “benevolently appears” to those who love her, “in their ways, and meets them with her unfailing providence.” Moreover, we should not listen to those who think that divine providence governs only the highest regions of the world, those on the outer edge of (that is, above) our atmosphere, which is denser; but that the lowest part—the earth and the sea, and the earthly atmosphere that is closer and thus permeated with humidity because of evaporation from the land and the sea (and in which winds and clouds are formed)—is rather ruled by chance, agitated by random movements. Against these the psalm speaks that, after having praised the heavenly beings, turns its attention to those of earth and says, “Praise the Lord of the earth, you sea monsters and all you deeps. Fire and hail, snow and ice, storm winds which fulfill his command.”\n"

Afterward, they were no longer in the state in which they had been created but were subject to corruption in conformity with their thoughts, and death dominated and reigned over them. In fact, the transgression of the precept returned them to their nature, and given that they came into existence out of nonexistence, it makes sense that in the course of time they would be subject to a corruption that tends to nonexistence. Indeed, if at one time their nature was nonexistence, and they were called into existence thanks to the presence and the goodness of the Word, it follows that human beings, now deprived of the knowledge of God and tending toward nonexistence (evil, in fact, does not exist, whereas good does exist because it was created by God, who is), would also be deprived of external existence. This is what it means to remain in death and corruption after decomposition. Human beings are mortal by nature, because they were made from nothing. But if they had preserved their likeness to him who is, by contemplating him, they would have diminished their natural corruption and become incorruptible, as Wisdom says: “Respect for laws is the guarantee of incorruptibility.” Being incorruptible, they would have lived like God, as a passage of the divine Scripture declares: “I said, You are gods and all children of the Most High.

If you wanted to find a scriptural passage on this, you would find, “The desire for wisdom leads to a kingdom.” And there are many other testimonies concerning this concupiscence in a good sense. It is very interesting to note that when speaking of desire in a good sense, the object that is desired is always expressed. On the contrary, if only concupiscence is spoken of, without adding the object, it must be understood in a bad sense. Thus in the cited passage it says, “The desire for wisdom leads to a kingdom.” If it had not specified, “for wisdom,” it certainly would not have said, “Concupiscence leads to a kingdom.” The apostle writes, “I would not have known concupiscence, if the law had not said, ‘Do not covet.’ ” It does not specify the object of that desire or what it is prohibited to desire, yet it is certain that, expressing himself in this way, he is referring to a disordered desire.\n"

Acting, then, with such wisdom and love toward humanity, what does Emanuel do? He reunites both natures in one, that is, the creature that had been privileged with the grace of immortality (the soul) and that linked to corruption (the body) in a birth that comes from their union. He who in the beginning fashioned human beings from the earth was fashioned from the Virgin, taking flesh from the Holy Spirit and from her. This flesh is consubstantial with ours, which is animated by a soul endowed with intellect. And this did not take place through sleep, by concupiscence or with the emission of human seed. What characterized our creation at the beginning was a coming in the flesh without seed. But for us, what distinguishes this second way of coming into existence is to come entirely from the woman. (Likewise, the conception took place in time, because “the time came for her to have her child.”) The sacred Scriptures say on the one hand regarding the mother of God that this took place in a marriage but on the other hand that everything began without her having experienced carnal union and was accomplished in virginity, since, after the birth, the seal of her virginity remained intact.\n"

Listen to holy Solomon, who speaks to us of this openness: “Therefore I prayed, and in me prudence was increased. I implored, and the Spirit of wisdom came to me.” So as to receive wisdom from God, he did not ask for riches or noble descendants or power, but he asked for wisdom. And he obtained everything that he did not ask for. For this reason Scripture says that the vastness of his heart was so great that, like the sand of the sea, it could not be measured. So that you would understand this greatness, he consciously says of himself, “Write it in the vastness of your heart.” Therefore, one who has wisdom should not keep it hidden, not even for an instant, but should celebrate it in public. He should proclaim everywhere, with authority, what prudence inspires in him.\n"

        "txt": "Beloved brothers and sisters, how is it that Solomon, though possessing wisdom in such great abundance and knowing all those things hidden in the secrets of mysterious providence, says that some things are impossible to know? He clearly received wisdom from God. He knew the beginnings of the ordering of the world7 and about the heavens that all see, suspended at an unreachable height. He knew how the world is surrounded and covered by air, balanced in equilibrium in its midst and attracted downward by its inert weight. He knew the reasons why the eager course of the waves of the liquid element roils within the limits fixed by the shores. He knew the principles and ends of things and the relationship between the two. Nor were the divisions and changes of times unknown to him. He understood how the years succeed one another, as the world completes its cycle, and why the stars followed their course, sometimes unexpectedly going ahead or remaining behind, as well as the place of their rising and setting. And he knew many other things, because he was told them by wisdom. It is surprising that he would say that some things were beyond his reach or that he could not know or see them. But, because everything collected in the divine books by the proclamation of the prophets had its preordained time, it is right that Solomon could not know, prior to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, about the flight of an eagle, or a serpent on the rock, or a boat that ploughs the waves or the way of a young man in his youth. It was not yet the time in which the reality would emerge from shadows or the truth from the image. To us, however, our Lord Jesus Christ has shown that everything concerning him was written in the Law11 and that, for us, nothing is hidden that will not be revealed. And after that book sealed with seven seals, which no one could open except Christ, it was permitted and granted to us to see. We know all things, as the Lord says, “I bless you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you kept these things hidden to the wise and have revealed them to the simple.” Furthermore, “To you it has been given to know this mystery.” And I have said all this, not as a reproach to Solomon because he did not know things that he could not have known but to indicate that it was not yet the time to know them.\n"

Solomon says to have preferred this light to his health, wanting always to delight in its beauty. Does he not say, “I loved her more than health and beauty, I preferred the possession of her to light itself, because the splendor that comes from her never sets”? For this reason, having desired this light, in his distress the prophet David proclaimed, “Send forth your light and your truth.” And also, “In your light we see light.” In the splendor of this light the Son anticipated his manifestation on the mountain to the three disciples. They prostrated themselves, deathly afraid, convinced that their lives were about to end. In fact, the Son proclaimed this light by showing it in himself, admonishing his disciples that they should walk in it: “Walk while you have the light.” And further, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life.” And the Evangelist also says, “He was the true light, which enlightens every person who comes into this world.” If it has been shown that this light that is promised to the faithful is in the Son and is eternal along with him who is eternal, how is it that you separate the Son from the Father’s inaccessible light?\n"

Given, then, that it is not possible for a person who lives in the flesh to know anything about hidden and invisible realities unless he receives some image and likeness of it from visible things, for this reason I think that the one who created everything in wisdom created all the species of visible things on earth in such a way as to bear within them a principle of the knowledge of invisible and heavenly realities. Through them, therefore, the human mind can raise itself to spiritual understanding and seek in heavenly realities the principles and causes of things. Thus, instructed by the wisdom of God, it also can say, “I have known everything that is hidden and manifest.” In this sense it also knows the essence of the world, not only the visible and corporeal world that is before the eyes of all but also that incorporeal and invisible world that is hidden. It knows the elements not only of the visible world but also of the invisible world, and the properties of the one and the other.\n"

Now, why do we say that the Holy Spirit moves, given that he contains everything and there is no place where he is not? As it is written, “The Spirit of the Lord fills the universe.” And yet, when Wisdom’s praises are sung, it is added, “In her there is a spirit intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, mobile.” And a little later, “friend of human beings, stable.” These words raise a big problem for us. Why is it said that this Spirit who fills everything is simultaneously mobile and stable? If we recall, however, the usual way in which human beings express themselves, it will not be difficult for us to discover the writer’s meaning. A person moves about freely in the area in which he lives—he might be found anywhere, and often he is in places we would hardly believe. Now, it says that the all-powerful Spirit is both mobile and stable, to indicate his universal presence. It says that he is stable, because by his essence he encompasses everything; that he is mobile, because he reaches even those who do not know it. He is called stable, because he holds all things together, mobile because he makes himself present to all. Thus the brightness of the fire moves in the midst of the living winged creatures, with its glow, because the Holy Spirit makes himself present simultaneously to each and to all. He enkindles those he reaches and enlightens those he enkindles, so that, after their former coldness, ablaze, they would burn, and with the fire of the love they have received, they would emit the flames of a good example.\n"

And they would accept that we teach with the authority of Scripture, since it is written, “Because in wisdom there is a spirit intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, mobile, penetrating, without blemish.” The Scripture calls him “without blemish.” But has it perhaps lied regarding the Son, so you might believe it has also lied regarding the Spirit? In fact, the prophet said in the same passage of the book of Wisdom that “nothing defiled gains entrance into her.” Wisdom is without blemish, and its Spirit is without blemish. If, therefore, there is no sin in the Spirit, he is God. But how could the one who forgives sins be guilty of sin? Therefore he has not committed sin.

In fact, brothers and sisters, I have said something to you as best I can (if I have in fact understood something), and likewise you have understood as best you can.

Why is this? “The corruptible body weighs down the soul.” Therefore, as long as we are on earth we will be cold, whereas speed burns with heat—and all hot things are fast, but what is cold is slow.

Thus finally another testimony of Scripture says, “By her purity she pervades all things.” And a little later, “She reaches mightily from one end to the other, and governs all things well.” And if now we hear that wisdom reaches from one end to the other, we must understand that if she reaches from one end to the other, she surpasses both ends by the immensity of her infinite nature. Indeed, only one who cannot be enclosed within creation can reach the entire creation, since, if in filling the heavens she is immeasurable, she is likewise infinite in reaching from one end to the other.\n"

        "txt": "For other heretics [the Arians], Christ, who is the very way by which one goes to the Father, is not equal to the Father according to his divinity. And even if he says, “I and the Father are one,” they say, “If he was sent by the Father, he is inferior. The one who sends is greater than the one who is sent.” This is a human argument, not a divine testimony. O heretic, the Trinity’s way of doing things is different from yours, and you do not understand it, because you understand it carnally. Your heart is not pure, even regarding God. In fact, Christ is called “sent” in that he assumed human existence. As God, he is equal to the Father. Where did the Father send the Son that he himself would not be, together with him? Where did the Son go, that he would not be with the Father, as he says, “I am in the Father and the Father in me,” and, “Philip, one who has seen me has seen the Father.” He is the one who says through the prophet, “I fill heaven and earth,” and of whom Solomon says, “He reaches from one end of the earth to the other with power, governing all things well. By his purity he pervades and penetrates all things.” But you, heretic, say that the one who sends is greater and the one who is sent less, because you think in terms of intervals of time. But you err greatly by placing within time the one who made time. If you profess that the Father is God and that the Son is God and believe that the Father and the Son are eternal, do not consider the Son inferior because he made you, just because he made himself inferior to redeem you. But, you reply, he said, “The Father is greater than I.” If you mean this phrase regarding the humanity he assumed, you err no longer. He says, “The Father is greater than I” in the same way that the prophet said of him, “You have made him a little less than the angels.” Tell me, under what aspect do you consider him to be inferior? Power? “The Father judges no one, only the Son.” Works? “Everything was made through the Son.” If you believe, regarding time, that because you are older than your son, it is like this with God and his Son—may God keep the faithful from hearing these words! It is unworthy to believe such things of God. If in fact the Son is the Word according to the divinity of God, as John the Evangelist says, “In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God,” could there have been a time when the Father was without the Word, or was there a beginning before the beginning itself, given that the Son said that he was the beginning? Indeed, when the Jews asked him, “Who are you?” he replied, “The beginning.” Thus what is written in Genesis, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,” refers to the Son, who is the beginning. So, the Father is always God and the Son is always God, because the former has never not been Father and the latter has never not been Son. The Father did not diminish himself in generating the Son but generated from himself another like him, so that he would remain entirely in him. The Holy Spirit is not separated out as though he were a portion of that from which he proceeds; rather he is complete from another who is himself complete. And by proceeding from him, the Spirit does not diminish him, nor by being united to him does the Spirit make him any greater. And these three are one God, of whom the prophet says, “You are the only great God.”\n"

Elsewhere the apostle says, “He made him heir of all things, and through him he also made the world, the one who is the radiance of his glory and the imprint of his being.” The apostle says that he is an image, and Arius says that he is different. Why, then, speak of an image, if he were not the same? People ordinarily do not accept the image of a portrait as being different from the original, but Arius asserts that the Father is different from the Son. He maintains that the Father generated someone who is different from him, as though he were incapable of generating someone like himself. The prophets say, “In your light we see light.” They say, “He is a reflection of the eternal light, an unspotted mirror of the majesty of God and an image of his goodness.” See in how many ways they speak. “Radiance,” because the brightness of the Father’s light is in the Son. “Unspotted mirror,” since the Father is visible in the Son. “Image of his goodness,” since it is not one body seen reflected in another but the whole power of the Godhead in the Son. “Image” teaches that here is no difference. “Imprint” indicates that he is the manifestation of the Father. “Splendor” bespeaks eternity. In fact, the “image” is not the bodily face, nor is it made with colors or from wax but is simply from God. He is from the Father, pouring forth from the spring.\n"

When it says “splendor of the eternal light,” what else can be meant but that it is the light of the eternal light? Light’s splendor—what is it, except light? It is therefore coeternal with the light of which it is the light. Nevertheless, the Scripture preferred the expression “splendor of the light” to the other, “light of the light,” so that no one would believe that the light that emanates is darker than that from which it emanates. Rather, hearing it called its splendor, it is easier to think that the one owes to the other its brilliance, rather than that one shines less brightly than the other. But because there was no chance that anyone would think the generating light to be inferior (no heretic has dared to assert this, nor does it seem believable that one would dare to do so), the Scripture anticipates the notion that the emanated light would be darker than the generating light. It eliminated this conjecture by saying, “It is the splendor of that light,” that is, of the eternal light, thus showing his equality. Indeed, if it were inferior, it would be the shadow, not the splendor. And if greater, it would not emanate, because it could not surpass that from which it was emanating.\n"

But even with these, God undoubtedly loves their souls in some way, because they exist, live and feel, and in any case they are greater than beasts, even if they are dull-minded souls. But that love is different, of which it is written, “God loves no one so much as the one who lives with wisdom.” You, however, ask why God has more love for the souls of babies, for whom he provides the washing of regeneration, sending them to the kingdom, and why would he not give this benefit to others, since babies have no merits of the will to distinguish them, nor is there preference of persons with God. This is a completely stupid argument, which you are always bringing up to us. That where it was said, “You love souls,” it did not say “all souls,” there is no question. Perhaps it was said this way in the sense that God creates all souls but loves only those whom he distinguishes from the others, not based on their merits but by the generosity of his grace, so that they might live with wisdom, as it is written, “God loves no one so much as the one who lives with wisdom—but the Lord gives the wisdom!”\n"

A goodness that does not prevail over every evil is not perfect, nor is a medicine perfect if some disease cannot be cured by it. Indeed, it is written in the sacred texts, “Evil does not prevail over wisdom.” Our physician’s omnipotence is proclaimed in the psalm with these words, “Bless the Lord, my soul, and all my being bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, my soul, and do not forget all his benefits. It is he who pardons all your sins, who heals all your weakness, who rescues your life from the grave, who fulfills your desires with good things, who crowns you with mercy and goodness. Your youth will be renewed like the eagle’s.” I ask you: What should we think cannot be forgiven us, since the Lord is kindly in all our misdeeds? Or what should we suppose cannot be healed in us, since the Lord heals all our weaknesses? Or how is it possible that one who is whole and righteous would still have some lack—one who is content to desire good things? Or up to what point do we think that one could not avail himself of the benefit of the full remission of sins—one who has been crowned with goodness and mercy? Let no one, therefore, remain in his infirmity, despairing of the physician. Let no one destroy himself in sins, belittling the mercy of God. The apostle declares that “Christ died for the godless.” And he likewise says, “Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.”\n"

Some others come from rotten wood or grasses, and others from rotten fruit. Regarding all these animals, we nonetheless do not have the right to say that God did not create them, since they all have a certain natural beauty appropriate to their species. This beauty can provoke greater wonder in one who considers them closely, leading him to even greater praise of the almighty Artisan who made all of them in Wisdom, which, extending from one end of the earth to the other and governing all things well, leaves not even the lowest creatures of nature without form. These creatures decay, as is appropriate to their species (something that horrifies us to see, recalling the punishment that made us mortal). He creates animals, however, having tiny bodies but acute senses.

By the same word through which he had created everything from nothing, he would restore what was lost. In fact, “he speaks and everything is made; he commands, and all exists.” Let us not think that this power is diminished or changed in him “in whom there is no alteration or shadow of change” or that he is less powerful or wise in restoring than he was in creating. The hand of the all-powerful potter, whose paths are all truth and mercy114 and who, taking mud from the earth, raised it to the dignity of a rational nature, wanted in this way to reconstruct in fragile vessels what had been ruined. Thus the man’s sin would not remain unpunished, since God is just, nor did it remain unhealed, since he is merciful. If the one whose wisdom “extends mightily from one end of the earth to the other and governs all things well” were only just, he could have fought by his power against the seducer of the human race, bringing the lost sheep back under his dominion in the flock. But, by doing so, he would have only shown the excellence of his power and would not have exercised his healing mercy for the redeemed. Nor would it have become apparent with how much charity the Creator loved his creation—a creation he called to love him, offering in exchange considerable rewards—since miserable humanity, prior to receiving grace, would have obtained by merit what they otherwise would have received as a reward, even if they hardly deserved it. What the wisdom of God could have done with wisdom and power, he wanted to do with tenderness, uniting himself to the weakness of our flesh, which he had healed in the first place in himself. By this work, like a physician, he restored the human race to health. Not that it could not have been otherwise due to the skill and power of the Physician, but because an antidote corresponding to the illness could not have been more easily obtained. “The weakness of God is stronger than human beings, and the foolishness of God is wiser than human beings.”\n"

But by this use of language we are taught that he is the one who has been promised to the nations. By the Father’s work, the inheritance of the church has been espoused to him, through the assumption of the body that he took from the Virgin. But, to learn what we should understand by the designation “bride,” we must examine closely what is said elsewhere regarding the term. For example, Solomon says, “I sought to take wisdom as my bride.” And because he seeks a bride, he wants her to be rich, and he recounts the benefits of his bride, saying, “She manifests her nobility in a life of communion with God, because the Lord of the universe loved her.” And “if one desires wide experience, she knows what is past and infers what is to come.” And further, “A strong woman, who can find? Her value is far beyond precious stones.” All of this was said in Proverbs, because a proverb does not explain what the words say but displays the power of what is said using ordinary words. In the Gospels, the Lord teaches how a proverb must be understood when he says, “The hour will come when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs, but I will speak openly to you of the Father.” Therefore, according to the rules governing proverbs, we must recognize that the strong woman is she whom Solomon desired to take as his bride. Of her he says further, “I therefore decided to take her as the companion of my life. I am enamored of her beauty.”\n"

Hold her close, and she will make you great. Honor her, that she would embrace you.” And in the book entitled the Wisdom of Solomon, it is further written of wisdom, “I desired her beauty.” Nevertheless, I think that the Scripture used the term “desire” only where there was no possibility of equivocation. Indeed, whatever is passionate or shameful can be found in the desire for wisdom or in the one who claims to desire wisdom. In fact, if the Scriptures had said that Isaac desired Rebecca or that Jacob desired Rachel, one could have thought of passion or of something shameful in the holy men of God because of these words, especially among those who do not know how to raise themselves from the letter to the spirit. And precisely in this book that we have before us, it is clear that the word desire has been replaced by “love,” where it is said, “I implore you, daughters of Jerusalem: if you find my beloved, tell him that I am wounded by love.” It is as if she were to say, I have been pierced by an arrow of love. Therefore there is no difference if the sacred Scriptures speak of love or of desire, except that the term “love” is held in such high esteem that even God is personally called love, as John says, “Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves is born of God and knows him. The one who does not love, however, does not know God, because God is love.”\n"

What is more true than the fact that Wisdom teaches the truth of contemplation, a concept that I had thought was expressed by the term “sobriety,” or that it teaches uprightness of action, which I thought was indicated by the other two terms, “justice and virtue”? But the best codices of that translation have, “It teaches sobriety and wisdom and justice and virtue.” With these terms the Latin translator meant to designate the four virtues that pertain especially to philosophical language. He calls temperance sobriety, gives prudence the name of wisdom, names fortitude by the term “virtue,” and has translated only justice by its own name. Much later, consulting the Greek copies, I noticed that in the book of Wisdom the four virtues are designated by the exact terms assigned them by the Greeks.\n"

        "txt": "The Scriptures are accustomed to speaking of opinion in two ways. They in fact speak of opinion both when someone thinks something that is not true and when he knows with all certainty that something is true. Blessed Stephen, in the Acts of the Apostles, speaks of an opinion concerning uncertain knowledge when he says of holy Moses, “He thought that his countrymen would have understood that God was offering them salvation through him.” But, to show that this was an uncertain opinion, he adds, “But they did not understand.” Similarly, it is said in the same book when the angel brought blessed Peter out of the jail, “he still did not realize that what was happening through the angel was real: he thought he was having a vision.” In the book of Wisdom an utterly certain knowledge is given as an opinion, in the place where wisdom itself says, “And if one desires wide experience, she knows what is past and infers what is to come.” What does it mean that wisdom infers, if not that it knows with all certainty? Thus also Paul, who had the mind of Christ, spoke of thinking something that he knew with certainty, saying, “I consider, in fact, that the sufferings of the present moment are not to be compared with the future glory that will be revealed in us.” And neither in this case can it be said that Paul had an uncertain knowledge of these things. In fact, he had a certain knowledge of them. Similarly, blessed Jeremiah said of Christ, “He is our God, and he will not be compared with another.” Does “he will not be compared” perhaps not mean that another will not be known? Thus blessed Isaiah says, “Lord, beside you we have known no other. We have invoked your name.”\n"

It is said also in the book of Proverbs, “Son, do not let evil thoughts ensnare you, thoughts that abandon the teachings of youth and forget the divine covenant. Their dwelling is near death, and their paths with mortals, alongside the netherworld.” If evil thoughts, which have made their dwelling near death, are outside of death and not in it, they are certainly alive. And if they are near, but not in, the netherworld, the only remaining possibility is that what is not in death or in the netherworld would have life in heaven. For this reason it is said to God, “You have rescued my soul from death,” because, through faith, he has given life to the soul, saying, “My righteous one, through faith, will live.” And thus it is also said to him, “From the depths of the netherworld you have rescued my soul,” since souls are rescued from the netherworld by the grace of God, so that they would live in heaven. Thus the apostle says, “Our homeland is in heaven.” Moreover, how was the soul, which was near death because of evil thoughts, freed from death, if it was not dead? And how was it taken from the netherworld, if it was near the netherworld but not in it? If in fact it was not in death, it was not dead. But who does not know that the soul dies through an evil will—that is, through sin—since God says, “The soul that sins will die.” It is therefore certain that the soul that thinks wickedly, being near death, is in death, and being near the netherworld is in the netherworld. And what does the Savior say? “What is impossible for human beings is possible for God.”\n"

What, however, is the meaning of the phrase “a good soul fell to my lot”? One could imagine that in the creation of souls, if there is such a thing, some are good and others not, and these are distributed on the basis of a kind of lottery, which would decide which type of soul would be infused in each individual person. Or, at the moment of conception or birth God makes some people good and others not, in such a way that each of them would receive the soul that had been assigned to them by the draw. It would be odd if the cited text were a convincing argument, at least for those who believe that souls are created in another place and sent by God, one by one, into each human body. Not so, however, for those who assert that souls are sent into bodies based on the merits from works done prior to being united to the body. Indeed, based on what criteria could it be thought that souls, some good and others not, enter bodies, except according to their actions? This is inconsistent, however, with a nature in which all souls are created by him who creates all natures good. Far be it from us, however, to contradict the apostle, who, when speaking of the twins who were still in Rachel’s womb, says that, being as yet unborn, they had not done anything either good or evil. He thus concludes that, not based on works but by the grace of him who calls, Scripture says, “The older will serve the younger.” Let us therefore set aside for awhile the text being considered here from the book of Wisdom, because we must not ignore the opinion, correct or not, of those who believe that it especially and exclusively concerns the soul “of the mediator between God and humanity, the man Christ Jesus.” If necessary, we will examine the meaning of this text later in such a way that, if it cannot be applied to Christ, we will try to discover in what sense it must be understood so as to not contradict the doctrine of the apostle, starting from the hypothesis that souls have merits deriving from their actions prior to living in their bodies.\n"

In his generation, Joseph offered nothing other than his service and affection. Thus Scripture, for his faithful service of a father, also gives him the name.

She knows what is pleasing in your eyes.” And the Lord, in the Gospel, said, “No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and the one to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.” And further, “No one has ever seen God; only the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, has revealed him.” And to the Jews he says further, “You do not know him. I, however, know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him, I would be like you, a liar.” And in the same passage, “The one who is from God listens to the words of God.” And still, “I know him, because I come from him.” Therefore, we have taught that the Son always sees the Father. How is it that you hold that he cannot see him?\n"

But he could be said to have been sent either when the Word made flesh was manifested in this world—and thus he says, “I was born of the Father and have come into this world”16—or when in the course of time he is perceived by someone in their spirit, in the sense in which it is said, “Send her, that she might assist me and share in my labors.” Now, what was born from Eternity exists eternally, for it is “the splendor of the eternal light,” whereas what is sent in time is known by someone. But when the Son of God was manifest in the flesh, it is into this world that he was sent, in the fullness of time, through his birth of a woman. “For, since in the wisdom of God the world, by its own wisdom, could not know God—given that the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it—it pleased God to save those who firmly believe through the foolishness of what is preached.” That is, it pleased him that the Word would become flesh and dwell among us. But, when in the course of time he comes forth and is perceived in the mind of someone, it is rightly said that the Word is sent, but not into this world, because he clearly does not appear sensibly, that is, he is not perceived by the senses of the body. Nor are we in this world when, according to our capacity, we attain something eternal with our spirit.\n"

It did not say, however, “through my flesh.” If it had said this, it would still be possible that Christ was meant by “God,” for Christ will be seen by our flesh in the flesh. But, even understanding it of God, it is only equivalent to saying, “I will be in my flesh when I see God.” And the apostle’s phrase, “face to face” does not lead us to believe that we will see God with the face of this body, in which we have our bodily eyes. Rather, we will see him continuously with the mind. If the face were not also that of the interior person, the apostle would not say, “And we, with unveiled faces, seeing as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, will be transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the action of the Spirit of the Lord.” Nor do we interpret differently what is proclaimed in a psalm, “Draw near to him, and you will be enlightened, and your faces will not blush with shame.” One draws near to God by faith, which is certainly of the heart, not the body. But we are not unaware of the valid reasons that the spiritual body has for drawing near to the Lord, since we speak of a reality outside our experience, and because in this matter an authoritative passage of sacred Scripture that can be interpreted unequivocally does not come to mind or help us. Thus, necessarily, what we read in the book of Wisdom is also true of us: “The reasonings of mortals are timid and our reflections uncertain.”\n"

A full belly spurs the heart to vice, oppressing the mind so that it cannot taste heavenly piety. “The body,” it says, “which decays, weighs down the soul and burdens the mind, which harbors many thoughts.” Thus also the Lord says, “Do not let your hearts be weighed down with carousing and drunkenness.” The stomach must therefore be kept empty with the temperance of fasting.

How can what God works, mysteriously, be clear to us? Moreover, what eye of the heart can be so acute as to be able to gaze on God? And, indeed, who could understand things that are far superior to us, even if someone were to speak about and explain them? In fact, our Lord Jesus Christ once spoke to Nicodemus of spiritual rebirth, saying, “Truly, truly I say to you, if a person is not born again, he cannot enter the kingdom of God,” etc. But because he understood nothing, in the end Christ, revealing the coarseness of human intelligence and how far it is below the subtlety of certain concepts, says, “If you do not believe when I spoke to you of earthly things, how will you believe if I speak to you of heavenly things?” Then he adds, “Truly, truly I say to you: we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen, but no one accepts our testimony.” As you can see, what is above us remains inscrutable. If it is true, as it is written, that “only with difficulty do we know the things at hand,” should we not think, without making further inquiries or vain research, that faith is indispensable for everything that surpasses our logical capacities? In this area, the most splendid ornament is prudence.\n"

The apostle says of them, “The animal person, however, does not understand the things of the Spirit of God. They are foolishness to him, and he is not able to understand them, because they can be judged only through the Spirit.” Thus the apostle’s authority affirms that heretics are above all carnal and earthly. In fact, blessed Paul also numbers heresy among the works of the flesh. And the blessed apostle Jude also calls those who separate from the church earthly, saying, “These are those who provoke divisions, natural people, devoid of the Spirit.” This is precisely what we saw the apostle Paul say: “The animal person, however, does not understand the things of the Spirit of God.” We must not be surprised, then, that those who do not have the Spirit of God are incapable of comprehending divine things. In fact, it is written in the book of Wisdom, “Who has known your thoughts, if you have not granted him wisdom and sent him your holy spirit from on high?” Therefore the holy apostle further states that the things of God are revealed only by the Holy Spirit when he says, “But God revealed these to us by his Spirit.” And a little later he continues, “Now, we have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit of God, to know all that God has given to us.”\n"

And the man had responsibility for everything that was under him, but even more so, he had to attend to the One above him. Keeping in mind the One who was above him, he would have peacefully dominated what was below him. Separating himself from the One who was above him, he came to be dominated by what was below. Take the example of three people. One of them has a servant and also a master (it often happens that wealthy servants have servants under them). Note well: such a person has a servant and a master. He is subject to the one and commands the other. With respect to the servant he is superior, with respect to the master he is inferior. In the third position we place the one who is the servant of the servant, and in the first position the one who is the master of the master. In the middle is the one who is servant and master—the master of his servant and the servant of his master. The third is therefore only a servant, the first only a master, whereas the one in the middle is both servant and master. He will possess his servant peacefully if he is not in conflict with his master. And yet we have spoken of three persons, all three of the same race, all three of the same essence, all three of the same nature. The same cannot be said of the following three: God, human beings and creatures inferior to human beings. Of an entirely different condition and of a very different substance are the maker and what is made, the producer and the product, the craftsman and his work, the creator and his creature. As for created things, by a generic term they are all called creatures, but they differ between them in nature, dignity, merits and condition.\n"

It cannot be recognized if it does not enter the soul of the person. It is said of wisdom, “Though remaining in itself, it renews all, and through the ages it enters holy souls.” And so that we should not think that to move into souls is something different than to enter them, the text of Scripture refers to it again with these words, “It freed a holy people and a blameless race from a nation of oppressors. It entered the soul of a servant of the Lord and withstood fearsome kings with wonders and signs.” This entry into souls is also proclaimed in the Apocalypse of John: “See, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone listens to my voice and opens to me, I will come to him, I will sup with him, and he with me.” By this same movement the Father and the Son enter the one who loves them, and they establish their dwelling in him, as the Son says: “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and the Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him.” And if this coming of the Father and the Son to the one with whom they make their dwelling were exterior and not interior, we would then like to know: where will they come to, and where will they make their dwelling with him? Moreover, we have seen that Christ dwells interiorly in his faithful ones, as Paul proclaims, saying, “That Christ would dwell in your hearts through faith.”\n"

The Jews were to ask the Egyptians for gold and silver objects and clothing and, carrying them away, to despoil the Egyptians of what they had given them under the devastating shock of the loss of the firstborn. Fearing also for themselves, the Egyptians sent the Jews away with all they had given them, so that “to the just,” as the prophet says, would be restored “the reward of their labors.” Considering the two cities they built for the Egyptians, the spoils the Jews carried away in no way constitute a theft but only the restitution of what was owed them. In fact, this passage had a mystical sense. According to the divine command, they must slay an unblemished year-old lamb under the tent, bathing the doorposts of the house with its blood. None of its bones are to be broken. It must be eaten with bitter herbs and unleavened bread, with loins girded, in all haste. Nothing must be left for the next day. The authority of the Gospel tells how all of these instructions, which had a symbolic sense, are to be fulfilled. It commands us to eat the flesh of lambs until that day that will have no sunset—that is, until the resurrection—“not with the old yeast but with the unleavened bread of purity and truth.” We are to eat after marking with his blood the doorposts of those on whose foreheads his cross will shine, eating “with bitter herbs,” it says, that is, with those who pass a bitter life in grief.

Similar to this passage is the one pronounced by the Lord through Isaiah against his adversaries: “See, my servants will eat, and you will be hungry. See, my servants will drink and you will be thirsty. See, my servants will rejoice and you will be downcast. See, my servants will shout for joy of heart, but you will cry out for sorrow of heart and howl for anguish of spirit.” One must therefore receive that drink that rises from the springs of Israel, and the one who drinks it will have in himself a “spring of water that wells up for eternal life,” that drink that the Savior promises he will drink together with the apostles in the kingdom of the Father. It gladdens the hearts of human beings, so that those who drink it can say, “Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness.” And, full of the Holy Spirit, the mother of the Lord prophesied, “He has filled the hungry with good things,” those who previously did not have the food of the Lord, and “he has sent the rich away empty,” those who did everything they could to do away with him, rejecting the one whom they recognized to be a prophet. Of them, that is, of the Jewish people, the psalmist elsewhere sings, “The rich grow poor and are hungry.” “But those who seek the Lord,” that is, the multitude of the peoples, “lack nothing.”\n"

Affected as we are by diffidence and by lack of faith regarding his precept, indeed his counsel, which says, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell (that is, abandon) all of your belongings, then come and follow me,” we rebel with a futile perverseness, turning again to the pursuit of earthly goods. And then, once the devil has our soul bound by these chains, what else does he need to do, when he wants to remove our spiritual joy, than to sadden us by the decrease or the total loss of earthly goods? He seeks a very precise goal with his clever deceptions. Indeed, once the sweetness of the Savior’s yoke and the lightness of his burden become heavy (through the perversity of our vicious longing), once we are trapped by the snares of those riches we have acquired in view of our rest and tranquility, will he not continuously torment us with the lash of worldly cares, drawing from our very selves the reasons for tearing us to bits? “Everyone is caught in the snares of his sins.” The prophet also says, “Look, all you who light the fire and surround yourselves with flames: walk by the heat of your fire, in the midst of the flames you have ignited.” Solomon also testifies to this: “Everyone will be punished through that by which he has sinned.” The pleasures that we enjoy end in torments, and the delights and pleasures of the body will turn against their author like executioners.\n"

And see, you will be mute and unable to talk until the day on which these things take place, because you have not believed my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.” Very fittingly was he punished by the loss of his voice, since the Creator of voices was to be born. Not only did he have to endure being the symbol of those who do not believe in the law, but he also did not believe that the voice that was commanded to announce these things had come by the work of the Creator, and, not believing the angel’s words, rightly was he deprived of his voice. In fact, as the wise Solomon says, “By those very things through which one sins, he is later punished,” so that he might learn to believe in the voice that comes from the wilderness.\n"

In fact, before the creation nothing existed besides the Creator. They were therefore in him—but how? In fact, we read that these things also, which are created, were in him. Should we perhaps identify these properties with God, or should we perhaps instead say that the works of the creation are, so to speak, in him who guides and governs them? But how can these properties be identified with God? He is in fact neither measure nor number nor weight, nor all of these properties taken together. Or should we perhaps think that God is to be identified with these properties as we know them in creatures and therefore limit in things we measure, number in things we count and weight in things we touch? Or should we alternatively think that, in the sense that measure assigns to each thing its limit, number gives to each its specific form, and weight draws everything to its rest and stability, it is God who is identified with these three perfections in a fundamental, true and unique sense, since it is he who limits and he who gives specific form and order to all things?

Memory, intellect and will (which we have said is love) are three inseparable aspects—one of these cannot exist without the others.

In fact, the whole of the heavens is contained in his palm, and the entire earth is enclosed in his hand. It is also the throne and footstool for his feet, as it is written, “To whom the whole world is like dust on the scales.” And thus he fills all things, containing all things from within and without, since this eternal, undivided Trinity is present everywhere and possesses the invisible fullness of the divinity.\n"

        "txt": "Let us hear what the Lord says to the prophet Jeremiah concerning idolaters: “Go and say, ‘Return, house of Israel, says the Lord. I will not show you an indignant face, because I am compassionate, says the Lord. I will not maintain my anger forever. Rise, acknowledge your guilt. You have been godless and followed strangers under every green tree.’ ” See what God promises to those who return after they fall: to forgive their sins, once they have turned from their apostasy. And the Lord says further by the mouth of Jeremiah, “My pampered children have had to trod bitter paths, pushed along like a flock kidnapped by the enemy. Have courage, children, cry out to God, because he who has tested you will remember you. Just as you thought to separate yourselves from God, return to him, seeking him with ten times the zeal, since the one who afflicted you with so many calamities will also give you, with salvation, everlasting joy.” O the mercy of God! How he calls to those who have fallen, that they might rise again! How he exhorts them so that, after their errors with idols, they would return to him! Like a benevolent Father he promises the eternal joy of salvation to his children if they mend their ways. Among other things, he says further by the same prophet, “I will lead them back to this country. I will firmly reestablish them and will not destroy them. I will plant them, and never again will I uproot them.” In fact, since he had threatened, “The one who sacrifices to the gods will be uprooted,” so that those who had sinned would not despair (as though, having been uprooted for having sacrificed to idols, they could not be replanted), he exhorts them, since if they repent they can be restored to their prior state. If they do not correct their crime, however, the sentence will be carried out. Moreover, it was preached to the Ninevites that their city would be destroyed after three days. Why after three days, if not that they might repent and the sentence be cancelled, or that they might remain in their sin and have even greater reason to perish? This is as he said through the prophet, “I do not desire the death of the one who dies, but that he would return to me and live.” And thus it happened that the Ninevites, destined to die for their sins, were pardoned because of their repentance. And why did the construction of the ark by Noah take a hundred years, if not so that those who saw and heard what was threatened would correct themselves? Indeed, God wants no one to perish. This is why we read in Solomon, “The Lord had mercy on sinners.” And further, “You have compassion on all, because you can do all things. You overlook people’s sins, that they might repent.” It is in this sense that the Lord, deploring the faithlessness of the Jews, says, “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you, how often have I wanted to gather your children, like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling!” Everywhere in the Law, then, the Lord exhorts sinners to conversion, not wanting that his creatures fall into perdition. And the Law that was given had no other purpose than that men and women would turn from error to the truth. Nonetheless, in the New Testament the author of the Law reveals himself as being more merciful, since he wanted to be more generous and rich in mercy19 at that time when he deigned to manifest the sacrament of his Son our Lord, so that grace would be more abundant through the preaching of the Son than through the preaching of the servants.\n"

He did not begin to love us only when we were reconciled to him through the blood of his Son. Rather, he loved us before the foundation of the world, calling us to be his children together with the Only-Begotten, when we were as yet absolutely nothing. The fact, then, that we “have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son” should not be heard and understood in the sense that he began to love what he had previously hated, as when an enemy reconciles with his enemy and the two become friends and begin to mutually love one another just as they once hated one another. We have been reconciled with one who already loved us, one with whom, due to sin, we had become enemies. The apostle will show whether or not I speak the truth. He says, “God shows his love toward us because, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” God felt love for us even when, behaving as his enemies, we committed sin. And yet with all truth it was said of him, “Lord, you detest all who do evil.” Therefore, in a way both wonderful and divine, he loved us even when he hated us. He hated that in us that he did not make, but since our iniquity had not completely destroyed his work, he knew how to hate in each of us what was our own work and at the same time to love what was his work. And this can be applied to everything else, given that this was said to him in all truth, “You despise nothing that you have created.” If in fact he had hated something he would not have willed it, nor could something exist that the Almighty had not called into existence—and he would not have called it if, in the thing he hates, there were not at least something that he could love. Rightly he hates and condemns evil, because it is contrary to the principle of how he does things. Nevertheless, even in what is contaminated by evil, he loves either the love with which he heals it or his judgment with which he condemns it. Therefore God hates nothing that he has created, since as the author of nature, and not of sin, he hates only the evil that he did not create. And he is moreover the author of the good that he draws from evil, whether healing it by his mercy or making it serve his secret plans. Granted therefore that God hates nothing of what he has made, who can speak adequately of the love that he feels for the members of his Only-Begotten? And, above all, who can speak worthily of the love that he bears for his Only-Begotten, in whom all things visible and invisible were made, things that he loves in a way that corresponds perfectly to the place each one occupies in the plan of creation?\n"

He in fact hates Esau, whom he himself made for common use. This difficulty is resolved bearing in mind that God is the creator of all creatures. Now, every one of God’s creatures is good, and every person is a creature—as a person, not as a sinner. God is therefore the creator of the body and the soul of the person. Neither of these two realities is evil, and God does not hate them, since he hates nothing that he has created. Now the soul is superior to the body. But God, author and creator of both, hates only sin in human beings. A person’s sin is disorder and perversion, that is, separation from the supreme Creator and attachment to inferior creatures.

Indeed, it is also written, “You, master of strength, judge with gentleness.” Therefore, even when he threatens he does not become angry, nor is he disturbed in any way. It calls him angry because he punishes and does justice. Similarly, people who do not want to amend their lives are as though they were alive, but they do not live, because vengeance for the first sin, and for those that they have added, hangs over them. This vengeance is called the wrath of God, because it proceeds from God’s judgment. Thus the Lord says of the one who does not believe, “but the wrath of God hangs over him.” We also, being born mortal, were under the wrath of God. Therefore the apostle says, “We were once by nature deserving of wrath, like the others.” What does “by nature deserving of wrath” mean, if not that we carry with us the wrath of the first sin? But if we convert, wrath ceases, and grace is offered to us. If, however, you do not want to convert, you add other offenses to the ones you were born with. And, “as in wrath,” you will be devoured even in the present time.\n"

Consequently, although God, who exercises power when he wishes, accomplishes his works without the passage of time, nonetheless temporal natures themselves carry out their movements within time.\n"

Indeed, it is said that God rested in the beginning after having finished the creation of the world, although he was not fatigued by his work, because he accomplished everything solely by his will.

And consequently, the effect of his will can ever fail, since we discover that his will itself is nothing other than his power. He who can do whatever he wants can want anything. Only of him, then, can it be truly said, “Whatever he wanted, he did.” And further, “You exercise power when you wish.” For this reason we said that in him there is as much power of the will as there is the will itself of the power. Since “power always accompanies his will,” in him will and power are one. In fact, just as God is not constrained by any necessity to promise what he does not want to do, so he is not impeded by anything in doing what he has promised to a lesser degree than he wants to or to delay its realization.\n"

This was so they would more easily pity those who suffer these same things and so respect his commandments. Imagine a wise farmer who, before sowing the seed, takes time to soften the land with plow and rake, so that the seed that he entrusts to it will not be lost. Likewise God soaks and softens his people for a long time before bestowing on them the salutary seeds of the commandments. Finally, so that it would be even more evident that this was why he inflicted these things on his people, we see that the Lord says in his commandments, “Do not molest or oppress the alien, because you were aliens yourselves in the land of Egypt.” We also read, “The great God, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes, who renders justice to the alien, the orphan and the widow. Delight in giving them bread and clothing, because you were like them in the land of Egypt.” And elsewhere it says, “When harvesting your fields, if you miss a sheaf, do not go back to get it. It will be for the alien, the orphan and the widow, that the Lord your God may bless you in all the works of your hands. You will remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt. Therefore I command you to do this.” It is easy, then, to recognize that this is why he afflicted his people with every kind of misery, so that from what happened to them they would learn to be merciful toward others, as it is written, “In this way you taught your people that the righteous must love.” In my opinion, it is very clear how God wants his people to be and how he shows, with many examples, the works by which they can gain his kindness.\n"

Those who are always breathlessly moving about portrayed as their type Artemis the hunter. The drunkard, Dionysus. The one who faced many difficulties, Heracles. One who had sexual intercourse with anyone, Zeus and Apollo. But it is pointless to enumerate all the passions that agitate human beings. Indeed, the Egyptians deviated from the truth more than anyone, not only worshiping their passions but also exchanging the supreme Orderer2 for winged creatures and four-legged animals, for wild and ferocious animals of land and sea—in short, with the beasts that the God of holiness had given them to serve them. They deviated more than others because, in a completely irrational way, they divinized the animals of their region. Even now they are not ashamed to worship the barking dog or the polecat who eats reptiles, the goat, symbol of incontinence, and the sheep, symbol of weakness, or the huge, terribly sad crocodile, or the ibis that feeds on poison, the kite and the sparrow hawk, or the crow, which seems the most despicable of all animals, and the serpent, who deviously slithers and is totally disgusting.\n"

The secret one takes place now, and the apostle Peter says of it, “It is time for judgment to begin with the household of the Lord.” It follows that the secret judgment is the pain by which each person is tormented now, so that he purifies himself, or by which he is admonished so that he converts or, if he has despised God’s calling and his teachings, he remains blind to damnation. The manifest judgment is rather that by which the Lord, when he comes, will judge the living and the dead, when all will know that it is he who assigns rewards to the good and torments to the wicked. But then, such a confession will not be a remedy for evils but a storing up of condemnation. It seems to me that the Lord spoke of these two judgments when he said, “The one who believes in me will pass from death to life and will not be judged,” that is, in the manifest judgment. In fact, the passing from death to life by means of the various sufferings with which God chastises every child he receives is precisely the secret judgment. “The one who does not believe,” rather, “is already judged,” that is, in this secret judgment he has already made himself ready to undergo the manifest one. We also read of these two judgments in Wisdom, where it is written, “As to reckless young people, therefore, you sent them a judgment to mock them. But those who were not corrected by this judgment experienced the just judgment of God.” Therefore, those who do not correct themselves following this secret judgment of God will be punished as they deserve in the manifest one.\n"

Paul explains the reason for this when he writes, “Those things that eye has not seen, that ear has not heard and that have never entered the heart of human beings, God has prepared for those who love him.” These many eternal, heavenly gifts have been prepared by the almighty Lord for his faithful, holy people throughout the world. But who is God, who has arranged all these things for us? Of him we say only that we do not know how to measure or express or understand him, that he is beyond all, outside of all, above all. He surpasses all his creatures; he is beyond his works, above all of them. I could try to express his greatness, but he is greater, or his beauty, but he is more beautiful. He is sweeter than every sweetness, brighter than every splendor, more just than all justice, stronger than all strength, gentler than all gentleness. Reason does not admit of the creature claiming equality with its Creator, nor that something produced is put on the level of the one who produced it.

Solomon says, “Blessed is the wood from which salvation comes.” Elisha made a piece of iron float after throwing a stick in the Jordan, and it is also written that “the tree of life” and “the plant of Sabek” lead to forgiveness. Moses lifted up the serpent on a stick, saving the lives of the people, and confirmed the priesthood in the tent with a blooming branch.\n"

There is an angel appointed for the sun, another of the moon and others of the stars. These angels, who accompany us during our time on earth, either rejoice or mourn over us when we sin. “Grieve,” it says, “over the earth because of its inhabitants.” It calls the angel for the earth using the same name as the earth itself, “earth,” as when it says, “The work of human hands and the one who has done it are accursed.” It is not that the inanimate thing itself is accursed, but what resides in the inanimate statue is indicated by the expression “human hands,” and from this it receives its name. In this way I would say that the angel appointed for the earth is designated also by the name “earth,” and the angel appointed for the water is designated by the name “water,” as when it is said, “The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and feared. The abyss trembled, a great crash of waters, and the clouds sent out their voice. Behold, your arrows pass.”\n"

Then he who always watches finally made inquiry. He watched in tolerance, he inquired so as to punish. “Into the idols of the peoples,” the book says, “there will be an inquiry, because God’s creatures have become detestable.” The pagans in fact provoke God through his creatures. How do they provoke God through his creatures? Because the carpenter shaped an idol, whereas God had created the wood. The goldsmith shaped an idol, whereas God had created the gold. From an object of yours, do you form something that he might detest? Why, from a creature of God, do you wickedly mold something that he should find detestable? You must form yourself well, so that he will love you. You want to impress your image in wood. Rather, receive within you the image of God. What do you destroy inwardly, and what do you sculpt outwardly? “God’s creatures,” the book says, “have become detestable. They have become a scandal for the souls of human beings and a snare for the feet of fools. Indeed, the beginning of fornication is the love of idols.” If a woman who has many husbands were to merit praise, then let someone who worships many gods also be praised. If a woman who offers herself to men is an adulteress, how much more a soul that worships gods that do not exist? “The beginning of fornication is the love of idols, and their invention a corruption of life.”\n"

Therefore the Word admonishes us to do penance and to “cry out in lamentation over the statues” and the idols that are “in Jerusalem and in Samaria.” Truly, if we who desire to be of the church commit sin, we fabricate “statues in Jerusalem.” If those who are outside of the church sin, as heretics, they make “idols in Samaria.” Nevertheless God, in conformity with his goodness, calls all to repentance, saying, “Cry out in lamentation, statues, in Jerusalem and in Samaria, since as I have acted toward Samaria and the works of their hands, so also will I act toward Jerusalem and its idols.” The threat will be carried out toward those who are in the church just as it was with the Samaritans.\n"

They did not listen to the voice of my being, from the birds of the air to the beasts.” And again reproaching those who, deviating from the profession of one being, did not want to remain in the being itself of faith, he says, “If they had remained in my being, I would have brought them back from their evil ways and their wicked thoughts.” And it is again stated clearly that the Son must not be professed as being other than the being of the Father but that, with faith, he must be contemplated in his very being with the eyes of the intellect, when the prophet says, “Who has been in the being of the Lord and has seen his word?” Thus, that the being of the Father is the Son was already clearly proclaimed by the oracles of the prophets, Solomon saying, “You in fact showed us your being and your sweetness that you have toward your children.” The Lord showed that these were poured out from heaven on the people of Israel in the figure and semblance of heavenly bread, saying in the Gospel, “It was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the bread from heaven.” He declares himself to be the bread when he says, “I am the living bread, who came down from heaven.” Of him the prophet David also says, “Human beings ate the bread of angels.”\n"

Thus, though the Scripture would call the dove the Holy Spirit17 and would say of the fire, “And tongues as of fire appeared, which parted and came to rest on each of them, and they began to speak in different tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance”—thus indicating that the Spirit was manifested through the fire just as through the dove—we can nevertheless not say that the Holy Spirit is God and dove or God and fire in the same way that we say that the Son is God and man.\n"

Disposition refers to the soul, attitude to the body. Thus Paul says … one must pray “without anger or dissension.” The attitude consists in “raising pure hands,” expressions that seem to me to be derived from the psalms, which say, “May the raising of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.” Regarding the place, “I want therefore that people pray in every place.” Regarding the orientation, the Wisdom of Solomon says, “To make it known that one must rise before the sun to give you thanks and worship you before the dawning of the light.”\n"

Thus he often lavishes blessings on us beyond our will, blessings that we are for the most part unaware of. If this surprises you, let me point out that this happened, not just to anyone, but to blessed Paul. That blessed one, in fact, being in many dangers and trials, often begged God that temptations would depart from him. God nevertheless did not respond to his request, except to the extent that it was advantageous for him, and to show this he said, “My grace is enough for you. Indeed, my power is fully manifested in weakness.” Thus, before telling him the reason why, he pours out blessings without Paul wanting or knowing about it. What is so unusual, then, if he commands us to be grateful in return for such tender care? So let us obey him, having this attitude always. In fact, nothing ruined the Jews more than their ingratitude, and this behavior alone brought on all those misfortunes, one after the other. Indeed, even prior to those misfortunes, it ruined and corrupted their souls. “The hope of the ingrate is like winter frost,” it says. It dulls the soul and makes it die, just like the body. This is born of arrogance and from believing oneself to be deserving of something. The contrite person, however, will give thanks to God not only for blessings but also for what seems to be against him, and, when he suffers, he will not think himself to have suffered unjustly. We too, then, the more we embrace virtue, the more we will humble ourselves, because virtue consists above all in this.\n"

By his blood he bought us back2 from him who had bought us, in that we were corrupted by sins. Leading this lamb to the sacrifice was the God who was in the man, the great high priest, as he himself attests, saying, “No one takes my life from me, but I myself give it. I have the power to give it and the power to take it up again.” All of the other sacrifices are related to this sacrifice by affinity, the sacrifices prescribed by the Law being a symbol of it. And in my opinion, the shedding of blood on the part of the noble martyrs are sacrifices similar to this one; not without reason does John the disciple contemplate them as surrounding the heavenly altar. “Who is wise enough to understand these things, intelligent enough to know them?” To grasp somewhat more contemplatively the reason for these sacrifices, which purify those for whom they are offered, we must understand the significance of the sacrifice of the daughter of Jephthah. Jephthah had defeated the Ammonites because of a vow, to which she who was to be sacrificed adhered, responding to her father’s words, “I have given my word to the Lord against you,” by saying, “Even if it is against me that you have given your word to the Lord, fulfill your vow.” In considering such events one could be led to attribute an element of great cruelty to God, to whom such sacrifices are offered for the salvation of human beings. One needs a more open and farsighted mind to reconcile this in light of the designs of providence, so as to be able to justify these things as both ineffable and beyond human nature, saying, “The judgments of God are great and difficult to tell. For this reason, ignorant souls fell into error.” Moreover, it is also attested among the pagans that in times of pestilence, many were given over to sacrifice for the common salvation. The faithful Roman Clement also admits that this occurred, basing himself on history;8 Paul testifies of him saying, “Together with Clement and my other coworkers, whose names are in the book of life.” Someone wanting to insult mysteries that escape the comprehension of the many finds the precepts regarding martyrs10 similarly absurd. God, however, considers that it would be better for us to confess his divinity at the price of the most atrocious sufferings than to free ourselves for a brief time from apparent evils, declaring our acquiescence to the will of the enemies of truth.\n"

And it is also said that the explanation of the world was contained in the pontifical vestment, as we find in the Wisdom of Solomon, where it says, “The entire world was in the priestly vestment.” Our earth with its inhabitants is also called world, as when the Scripture says that “the whole world is in the possession of the evil one.” And Clement, disciple of the apostles, refers to those places that the Greeks called antipodes and to the other parts of the earth where no one can reach (just as none of the people there can reach us), and he calls them “world,” saying, “The ocean cannot be crossed by people, nor the worlds that are beyond them, which are governed by the very dispositions of the Lord God.” We also call world this universe that is formed by the heavens and the earth, as Paul says, “The form of this world is passing away.” And our Lord and Savior also speaks of another beyond this visible world, which is difficult to describe and define in its reality. He says, “I do not come from this world.” As though he came from another world, he said, “I do not come from this world.” We said that it is difficult to describe this world, so as to not provide anyone with occasion to claim that we assert the existence of the images that the Greeks call ideas.
