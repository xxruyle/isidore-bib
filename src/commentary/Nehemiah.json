On the other hand, he relates more things concerning Nehemiah the eunuch, how he too asked for the building of the temple, and how Ezra performed the function of a scribe, while Josue, Baneas and Habia instructed the people. He relates that Ezra explained the knowledge of the Lord by reading; that the people, through his reading, understood what things must be done and celebrated the phase. They also observed a fast in the seventh month, and the feast of the Tabernacles, as is written. &quot;They had not done so since the days of Josue the son of Nun&quot;, he says. When Ezra saw Azotian women married to Hebrews, he mourned and cried, and made everyone promise to keep God's law, and he cast out those women, as being joined by unlawful union, and everyone swore to keep the law. And, thus sanctified and cleansed, they rejoiced, and each man went away to his house. It is also told about Ezra that, when the books had been lost owing to the people's negligence and the long captivity, he, being a man fond of virtue, industrious, and a scribe, kept them all with him, and eventually brought them forth and transmitted them to all, and thus preserved the Bible.\n"

Susa is the capital city of the kingdom of the Persians, as we read in the book of Esther. Not only Nehemiah but also the prophet Daniel calls it a “fortress,” “not because the city itself is a fortress, for as we have stated it is a capital city and a very powerful one, but because it is so solidly built that it looks like a fortress.” Now Susa means “riding” or “returning.” The name aptly befits the defenses of the mind of the faithful, especially of those who are charged with the capture of Jerusalem, that is, for the salvation of those who are occasionally snatched away from the church through the devil’s attacks but by repenting are brought back to the church again by the grace of God. For such people are in a returning fortress—that is, in the strength of a mind called back from the lowest delights to a longing for the heavenly homeland, from which they had fallen in their first parent; such people are in the very strong cavalry of the hearts of the saints who carry God as their rider, according to the prophet’s saying: “Mounting your horses, and your riding is salvation.” For the Lord indeed mounts his horses when he illuminates the hearts of preachers with the grace of his mercy so that he can rule them; and his riding is salvation because he not only carries to eternal salvation those over whom he presides by ruling them but also, so that he may likewise preside over them too, and through them makes others sharers of this same everlasting salvation as well.\n"

Nisan is the first month of the year, according to the Hebrews, in which they were always to celebrate Passover; this month we call April. Therefore, from what he said above, namely that he mourned, fasted, and prayed for many days, it is unquestionably evident that for four successive months (namely the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth) he gave attention to that most sacred devotion, waiting for an opportune moment in which he could tell his desire to the king. What is more, he was the chief butler;1 he used to offer the cup to the king and outwardly perform a joyful service, but inwardly was overcome by a grave sadness because he remembered that the holy city had been destroyed and that the people of God were held in disgrace and contempt by the enemies of God. Hence with those like him he bears witness, saying in a psalm: By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down and wept when we remembered you, Oh Zion.2\n"

But even now in the holy church, people are rightly afflicted and pricked by a salutary sense of remorse when, even though they themselves have repented of their past wrongdoings, they consider the fact that their neighbors still are subject to sins, so that, through the negligence of those who, having reformed, could have been profitable to many, the devil has free entry into the church, as through the walls of a ruined city. It is even more lamentable if those very ones who should have been profiting others through their teaching and personal example show to observers an example of destruction in themselves by living corruptly. For this is what is meant by the fact that the gates of Jerusalem were burned down by enemy flames: that those who ought, by living and teaching well, to have been introducing worthy people into the assembly of the elect and keeping unworthy people out, perish instead in the fire of avarice, self-indulgence, pride, strife, envy, and the rest of the vices that the evil enemy is apt to bring in.\n"

For priests build to the number of one hundred cubits4 when they enflame all those whom they are instructing with love and desire for eternal things.

Obviously this is the anger of heretics, these the words of those who in vain call themselves 'Samaritans' (that is, the 'guardians of God's law')1 despite the fact that they are greatly opposed to God and his laws inasmuch as, having been long separated from the House of David (that is, from the unity of Christ and the Church) by heresies or schisms or wicked works, they  “356” are afraid to see the walls of the faith being built lest their own irreverence might be attacked and excluded; this is the ridicule of all who claim that they know God, but in their deeds they deny him? for indeed the Samaritans used to serve the Lord but without repudiating their own ancient gods. Typologically, they are imitated today by Christians but in such a way that they also consider their stomach a god3/675/ and pursue greed (which the Apostle clearly calls slavery to idols)4 and, being slaves to the remaining allurements of the world, serve created things more than the Creator, who is praised forever.5 And so, just like heretics, such people do not want the walls of the Church to be restored in case they are forced by the growing state of piety to retreat from their own impiety; such ones are wont to call the Jews (that is, confessors of the faith)6 'feeble', and say that they will be easily overthrown by the Gentiles, since in the daily battle of souls they love sins more than obtaining the victory palm of virtue. And because there are some among the heretics who deny that pardon is given even to those who do penance after falling, it is rightly added in their person.\n"

For how many are there among God's people who willingly desire to obey the divine commands but are hindered from being able to fulfil what they desire not only by a lack of temporal means and by poverty but also by the examples of those who seem to be endowed with the garb of religion, but who exact an immense tax and weight of worldly goods from those whom they claim to be in charge of while giving nothing for their eternal salvation either by teaching them or by providing them with examples of good living or by devoting effort to works of piety for them?1 Would that some Nehemiah (i.e. a 'consoler from the Lord') might come in our own days and restrain our errors, kindle our breasts to love of the divine, and strengthen our hands by turning them away from our own pleasures to establishing Christ's city!\n"

So I sent messengers to them saying : 'I am doing a great work and cannot go down, in case the work is neglected when I come and go down to you'.1 The enemies of the holy city are urging Nehemiah to go down to the plains and to enter into a peace pact with them by together slaughtering calves as testimony to the arranged treaty, but he perseveres in  “362” the mountains so that the devout work is not neglected. So too, heretics and false Catholics want to have a fellowship of peace with true Catholics but with this stipulation, that they do not agree to ascend to the citadel of ecclesiastical faith or duty themselves, but rather they compel those whom they see dwelling on the peak of the virtues to go down to the lowest depths of wicked works or dogmas. And it is well that they want to enter into a pact with Nehemiah on one plain, doubtless because they desire that all those whom they are able to seduce be relaxed in the same freedom of the broader life that they themselves follow; and it is well that they wish to enter into a pact with him by together slaughtering calves, because false brethren are eager to offer the sacrifices of their prayer and action to God together with true Catholics, so that, when they are believed to be genuinely faithful, they might be able to corrupt these same true Catholics through the proximity of their association. But Nehemiah, representing the person of faithful teachers, by no means agrees to go down to the impious nor /925/ to be defiled with their sacrifices but remains devout in the virtuous works he has undertaken; and the more severely his enemies tried to frighten him, the more he himself strove to become terrifying to these same enemies by doing a good work.

Gatekeepers, singers, and Levites must be appointed to guard these same doors; it is clear that the character of all these accords with holy teachers. For the gatekeepers are those who have received the keys to the kingdom of heaven5 so that they might receive those who are worthy and humble but prevent the proud and the impure from entry into the heavenly city by saying: You have no part or lot in this business, for your heart is not right before God.6 The singers are those who with a devout voice preach the sweetness of this same heavenly homeland to their hearers; the Levites are those who always remain vigilant in regard to the observance of divine worship. Now Nehemiah ordered that The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot (that is, throughout the whole night), doubtless either in case the enemy invaded under the cover of darkness or else in case any of the citizens were to go out incautiously and be captured by the enemy and killed. Likewise, throughout the night of this age also, guardians of souls must act diligently to ensure that the observance of devout living is not neglected, allowing the devil to sneak in to disturb the company of the faithful or to seize and destroy one of their number. /1025/ But “365”  when the sun of righteousness1 appears and the light of future blessed-ness shines forth, no longer will there be a need for barriers of selfrestraint,1 because adversaries will no longer be given the ability to attack or tempt the faithful, since they will be condemned to eternal punishment along with their leader.

As Nehemiah was seeking to make plans and decide who should reside in the city which they had built, the seventh month arrived, for it was not far off. For since the wall had been completed on the twenty-fifth day of the sixth month, not more than five days remained until the beginning of the seventh month. The whole of this seventh month, from its first day until the twenty-second, was consecrated with ceremonies prescribed by the Law; when these had been duly celebrated, only then /1075/ did he return with the leaders and common people to decide who should be residents of the rebuilt city. The point to note here is the devotion and also the like-mindedness of the people who as one man (that is, with one and the same faith and love) came together at the Lord's temple; and they themselves asked their pontifex1 to bring the book and recount for them the commandments of the Law that they must observe, so that along with the rebuilt city, a structure of good works pleasing to God might spring up in case, just as before, neglect of religion should lead to the ruination of the city as well. And it is appropriate that the city was completed in the sixth month and that the people gathered in it to hear the law in the seventh; for in the law there are six days for working and a seventh for resting.2 And this, after we have done good work, is the form of our rest that is most beloved and most acceptable to the Lord - to abstain from servile work (that is, from sin) and devote ourselves to hearing and fulfilling his commandments with due diligence.1 This is why the Feast of Trumpets, by whose blast the people, amidst their prayers and offerings, were more fervently moved to remembrance of the divine law, was placed in the beginning of this same seventh month also.\n"

And the seed of the children of Israel separated themselves from every foreigner, and so on. /1300/ One should note the devotion of the people reformed after the captivity: when the feast which had been commanded by the Lord's Law had been duly completed, after just one day's intermission, they immediately came together of their own accord with fasting and with repentance, and diligently carried out “372”  what on the days of sacred readings and rejoicing they had heard must be done by separating themselves in both mind and body from the fellowship of those who were proven to be alienated from the Lord and his worship, lest through the association and examples of the wicked they should again fall into the evils of captivity and hardship which, they discerned, they had just at that time barely escaped after long revolutions of times and ages. And what are we to reflect on mystically about these matters except that, following the examples of such people, whatever we have learnt in a public meeting or reading1 should be done, we should reflect on again with mutual discussion among ourselves, and we should search out with careful scrutiny the ways we can fulfil each duty with the reproof of our heart or body.

The arrangement was now completed. It was begun as soon as the city was made, but until the total number of the people had been counted and the feast of the seventh month had been completed, it was impossible to determine who should reside in the holy city itself and who in the other cities. Now it is consistent with the figures of the sacraments that the rulers of the people are reported to have settled in Jerusalem. For it is proper that those in charge of the Holy Church should surpass the common people in the merits of their life by as much as they surpass them in the greatness of their power.5 For the remaining cities of Israel represent the devout lifestyle of the common people of God, whereas the act of settling /1400/ in Jerusalem specifically represents the conduct of those who, having already overcome the struggle of the vices, draw near to the vision of heavenly peace with an unimpeded mind, according to the psalmist's saying: The Lord loves the gates of Zion above all the tabernacles of Jacob.1 Hence it follows that the reason that a tenth part of the people chosen by lot take their dwelling in Jerusalem but the remaining nine parts reside in their cities is doubtless that it is a mark of the perfect (namely of those who wholly keep the precepts of the Decalogue in the love of God and neighbor) to draw near in mind to the heavenly secrets and, so to speak, to imitate the peace of highest blessedness amidst the whirlwinds of this transient life; and yet the door to eternal life also remains open to those who keep God's general commandments, according to what the Lord declares in the Gospel to the rich man who questioned him.2 For such people dwell as it were in cities given to them by the Lord because by keeping the sacred law they remain constantly vigilant to defend themselves from the attacks of the ancient enemy. But those who wish to be perfect and follow the Lord by selling all their belongings and giving them as alms for the poor3 are those who dwell as it were in the citadel of Jerusalem4 and next to the temple of God and the ark of the covenant because they approach the grace of their Creator in a more sublime way. It is well said that their dwelling in the holy city was granted to them not by the foresight of human choice but by the outcome of a lot, just as during Joshua's time the ownership of the rest of the cities was given to the children of Israel by lot,5 no doubt because both the small things of the small man and the great things of “375”  the great man /1425/ come about not through the freedom or industriousness of his own will but by the gift of the hidden judge and provider.\n"

It is even more lamentable if those very ones who should have been profiting others through their teaching and personal example show to observers an example of destruction in themselves by living corruptly.1 For this is what is meant by the fact that the gates of Jerusalem /75/ were burned down by enemy flames: that those who ought, by living and teaching well, to have been introducing worthy people into the assembly of the elect and keeping unworthy people out, perish instead in the fire of avarice, self-indulgence, pride, strife, envy, and the rest of the vices that the evil enemy is wont to bring in.

By these words it is clearly taught that all Israel (i.e. the ten tribes) were dwelling in their cities, in which even the priests and the Levites used to retain a share decreed to them by the Law.3 By contrast, those who had been chosen by lot from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin were dwelling in Jerusalem along with some from the priestly and Levitical tribe. For the tribe of Benjamin used to live there from ancient times because that city succeeded to it by lot,4 whereas the tribe of Judah entered there from the time of David when he made it the capital of the whole Israelite kingdom,5 and the tribe of Levi was added to them from the time when the ark of the covenant was brought to that place6 and God's altar and temple built. Consider too the following verses of this book and you will find that it calculates the inhabitants of Jerusalem from these tribes alone and even precisely adds the sum of all of them.7 But when /1450/ the catalogue of these ends, Scripture still took pains to add in which cities the other part of these same tribes settled, for it goes on:\n"

When they heard the law concerning the anathematizing of the two hostile nations, the faithful people immediately separated every foreigner from them, because we must so direct ourselves to the hearing of the truth, when we are prohibited by divine reading from any particular vice, we must immediately struggle to remove both from our deeds and from our conscience not only the one that happens to have been mentioned but whatever polluting vice we find in ourselves. “Neh. 13:5-6” He therefore made himself a large storeroom and there in front of him they were placing the gifts and incense and vessels, and also the tithes of corn, wine, and oil, the portions of the Levites and singers and gatekeepers, and the first-fruits of the priests. But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, and so on. This sentence, in which Nehemiah writes that he was not in Jerusalem, appears to pertain not to those matters that he had recounted above until this point, but only to the present passage. For during that previous time in which the city was built and dedicated, whatever was done and said seems to relate to when Nehemiah was still dwelling in Jerusalem; and when these things had been completed by his efforts, he returned to the king and it was in his absence that Eliashib made himself a large treasury, in which to store those articles that were necessary either for the ministry of the Lord's house or for the use of the ministers. He /1950/ did not even fear to put certain illicit objects in the treasury of the Lord's house which Nehemiah, when he returned to Jerusalem, was immediately keen to get rid of, for there follows:\n"

They who build the Dung Gate in Jerusalem, therefore, are the ones who ordain to the ministry of the holy church those through whom the filth of the vices is removed from the minds of the elect, but also through whom people of corrupt mind are kept away from the boundaries of the church while a shower of heavenly grace helps them and weakens every impurity, so that, according to the psalmist, “all who do evil” are eliminated “from the city of the Lord.”\n"

Typologically, they are imitated today by Christians but in such a way that they also consider their stomach a god and pursue greed (which the apostle clearly calls “slavery to idols”)5 and, being slaves to the remaining allurements of the world, serve “created things” more “than the Creator, who is praised forever.” And so, just like heretics, such people do not want the walls of the church to be restored in case they are forced by the growing state of piety to retreat from their own impiety; such ones are apt to call the Jews (that is, confessors of the faith)7 “feeble” and say that they will be easily overthrown by the Gentiles, since in the daily battle of souls they love sins more than obtaining the victory palm of virtue.\n"

For Solomon had made a bronze platform and had set it in the midst of the basilica, and it was five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high. And he stood upon it.1 For 'in the midst of the basilica' means in the midst of the courtyard of the priests, which surrounded the greater basilica of the exterior courts on every side of the temple, about which it is written earlier in the same book, he made the courtyard of the priests, and a great basilica.2 But Solomon, being a king, made a bronze platform, whereas Ezra, as a man of lesser power, built a wooden step to speak upon, /1125/ just as Solomon or Moses also made the altar of holocaust out of bronze3 and the descendants of the exiles replaced it with a stone one. But it should not be supposed that the wooden step holds a less perfect mystery than the bronze scaffold. For, as has often been said, just as bronze, for the length of time that it endures or for the sweetness of its sound, corresponds to the divine sacraments which fail with no passing of the ages and their sound has gone out into all the earth,4 in the same way wood too fits most aptly with these same sacraments on account of the trophy of the Lord's passion. The pontifex,5 therefore, stands out above all the people when he who receives the rank of teacher rises above the activity of the crowd by the merit of a more perfect life; but he stands on a wooden step that he had made to speak upon when he makes himself higher than the rest through exceptional imitation of the Lord's passion. Hence he deservedly obtains the trust to preach God's word freely; for he who disdains to imitate the Lord's passion in his own modest way has not yet mounted the wooden step from where he can stand above the weak, and for that reason it is necessary that such a scribe must preach the precepts of God in trepidation, fearing or blushing to propose that others must do what he has failed to do himself. And so it is aptly added in what follows:\n"

But against these we must, according to the apostle, take up the armor of God, “so that” we may be able to “resist on the evil day and stand perfect in all things.” Now it is well said that he stationed the people “behind the wall in a circuit” with weapons so that, surrounded by a troop of armed men, the builders might press on in building the wall with a freer and securer hand. For the grades of the faithful are divided up: some build up the church by adorning it with good works on the inside, while others, armed with the weapons of sacred reading, keep vigilant for heretics who attack the same church. The former in religious devotion strengthen their neighbors in the truth of the faith, while the latter wage a necessary battle against the weapons of the devil or of the vices with which they struggle to assault this same faith and with pastoral solicitude repel the wolves lying in ambush from the Lord’s sheepfold.\n"

And we should not pass over the fact that when David and Solomon were building this same city, nothing is said about armed builders or attacking adversaries; rather, the city destroyed by their wrongdoings is restored with greater labor and effort, first because the spiritual edifice, which is concerned with the salvation of souls, is such that, as soon as we are reborn in baptism through the faith and confession of the Holy Trinity, we are made, through God’s grace, his city and house without any effort of our own; but if after our ablution in the sacred font we fall back into sins through the devil’s seduction and the victorious enemy demolishes the defenses of our virtue with the fire of the vices, it is necessary for us to repair those buildings of good works that we have lost through more serious efforts of prayer, mortification, vigils, alms and a stricter life.

This famine had been caused not only by a scarcity of crops but also by the greed of the rulers, since they were demanding greater taxes from these people than they were able to pay. We see that this occurs among us in the same manner every day. For how many are there among God’s people who willingly desire to obey the divine commands but are hindered from being able to fulfill what they desire not only by lack of temporal means and by poverty but also by the examples of those who seem to be endowed with the garb of religion but who exact an immense tax and weight of worldly goods from those whom they claim to be in charge of while giving nothing for their eternal salvation, either by teaching them or by providing them with examples of good living or by devoting effort to works of piety for them? Would that some Nehemiah (i.e., a “consoler from the Lord”) might come in our own days and restrain our errors, kindle our breasts to love of the divine and strengthen our hands by turning them away from our own pleasures to establishing Christ’s city!But we should observe according to the literal meaning that the unhappy outcry of the afflicted people was attended by a threefold distinction. For some, compelled by the famine, were proposing to sell their own children to the more wealthy for food; others, sparing their children, wished rather to give up their fields and own homes for food; and some, by contrast, prohibiting the sale of both children and fields, were urging that they should merely borrow money for the king’s taxes, giving their fields and vineyards as a pledge until a fruitful supply of crops returned and they could restore the moneylenders what they had borrowed.\n"

And it is well that they want to enter into a pact with Nehemiah on one plain, doubtless because they desire that all those whom they are able to seduce be relaxed in the same freedom of the broader life that they themselves follow; and it is well that they wish to enter into a pact with him by together slaughtering calves, because false brothers are eager to offer the sacrifices of their prayer and action to God together with true catholics, so that, when they are believed to be genuinely faithful, they might be able to corrupt these same true catholics through the proximity of their association. But Nehemiah, representing the person of faithful teachers, by no means agrees to go down to the impious or to be defiled with their sacrifices but remains devout in the virtuous works he has undertaken; and the more severely his enemies tried to frighten him, the more he himself strove to become terrifying to these same enemies by doing a good work.\n"

        "txt": "According to the Hebrews, the month of Elul is the sixth month of the year, which is called September by the Romans. And it is right that the wall of the holy city is completed in the sixth month of the year, so that by this number the perfected action of the faithful, whether penitents or the innocent, might also be designated. For the perfection of a good work is usually designated by the number six, either because the Lord completed the creation of the world on the sixth day and rested on the seventh or because he wished us to sweat with good actions within the six ages of this world but to hope for a sabbath rest for our souls in the seventh, which comes in the next life. It is rightly completed on the twenty-fifth day of that same month, namely, on account of the five bodily senses, by the aid of which we ought to do good works outwardly: for just as the simple number five is often a figure of these senses, so when this is multiplied by itself to make twenty-five it designates these same senses with greater perfection. Therefore, we complete the wall of Jerusalem on the twenty-fifth day of the sixth month when, diligently surrendering all of our bodily senses to divine servitude, we bring the pursuits of the virtues that we have begun to a sure end and, with the Lord’s help, effectively complete whatever things have begun to do faithfully in defense of catholic peace.It is also fitting that the wall is said to have been completed in fifty-two days. For the fiftieth psalm—in which the prophet also prays specifically for the construction of this city, saying, “Deal favorably, O Lord, in your good will with Zion, that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up”—is one of repentance and forgiveness. On the fiftieth day of the Lord’s resurrection, the Holy Spirit, through whom not only the desire to repent is poured into us but also the gift of pardon is conferred on those who repent, came to the primitive church. Now there are two precepts concerning charity, namely, love of God and of neighbors, in which, once pardon for sins has been granted to us by the Holy Spirit, we are commanded to endeavor to attain eternal life. It is therefore most appropriate that when rebuilding the wall of the holy city that had been destroyed by the enemies, its citizens restore it in fifty-two days, because this, undoubtedly, is the perfection of the righteous in this life, namely, that they should not only, by repenting through the grace of divine inspiration, set right whatever sins they have committed but afterwards adorn themselves with good works in love of God and neighbors.\n"

Gatekeepers, singers and Levites must be appointed to guard these same doors; it is clear that the character of all these accords with holy teachers. For the gatekeepers are those who have received “the keys to the kingdom of heaven” so that they might receive those who are worthy and humble but prevent the proud and the impure from entry into the heavenly city by saying, “You have no part or lot in this business, for your heart is not right before God.” The singers are those who with a devout voice preach the sweetness of this same heavenly homeland to their hearers; the Levites are those who always remain vigilant in regard to the observance of divine worship. Now Nehemiah ordered that “the gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot” (that is, throughout the whole night), doubtless either in case the enemy invaded under the cover of darkness or else in case any of the citizens were to go out incautiously and be captured by the enemy and killed. Likewise, throughout the night of this age also, guardians of souls must act diligently to ensure that the observance of devout living is not neglected, allowing the devil to sneak in to disturb the company of the faithful or to seize and destroy one of their number. But when the “Sun of righteousness” appears and the light of future blessedness shines forth, no longer will there be a need for barriers of self-restraint, because adversaries will no longer be given the ability to attack or tempt the faithful, since they will be condemned to eternal punishment along with their leader. Thus in his Apocalypse John says about the future glory of the holy city, “And its gates will not be shut ever, for there will be no night in that place.”\n"

For since the wall had been completed on the twenty-fifth day of the sixth month, not more than five days remained until the beginning of the seventh month. The whole of this seventh month, from its first day until the twenty-second, was consecrated with ceremonies prescribed by the Law; when these had been duly celebrated, only then did he return with the leaders and common people to decide who should be residents of the rebuilt city. The point to note here is the devotion and also the like-mindedness of the people who as one person (that is, with one and the same faith and love) came together at the Lord’s temple; and they themselves asked their pontifex to bring the book and recount for them the commandments of the Law that they must observe, so that along with the rebuilt city, a structure of good works pleasing to God might spring up in case, just as before, neglect of religion should lead to the ruination of the city as well. And it is appropriate that the city was completed in the sixth month and that the people gathered in it to hear the Law in the seventh; for in the Law there are six days for working and a seventh for resting. And this, after we have done good work, is the form of our rest that is most beloved and most acceptable to the Lord: to abstain from servile work (that is, from sin) and devote ourselves to hearing and fulfilling his commandments with due diligence. This is why the Feast of Trumpets, by whose blast the people, amid their prayers and offerings, were more fervently moved to remembrance of the divine law, was placed in the beginning of this seventh month also.Even today too, according to the spiritual meaning, the construction of the holy city should be followed by divine reading and the frequent sounding of trumpets, no doubt because it is necessary that when a people has been initiated into the heavenly sacraments they should also, as occasion requires, be carefully instructed by divine discourses how they should live. Now he says that the people assembled “in the square that is before the Water Gate.” I think that by the Water Gate is meant the gate in the courtyard of the priests that surrounded the temple on all its sides in a square, especially on the temple’s eastern side, where there was the bronze sea for washing the hands and feet of those going into the temple, the ten bronze washbasins for washing the victims and the altar of burnt offering between which and the temple Zechariah son of Berechiah was stoned to death. The people did not have permission to enter inside the gate of this court but only the priests and ministers of the Lord; the people were accustomed to stand outside of this gate and especially in the square that was at its eastern side, in order to listen to the word or to pray. Therefore, it is appropriate that the people gathered before the Water Gate, because they were to be given spiritual drink by their high priest from the streams of Scripture.\n"

Moreover it was ordered that the setting up of tabernacles (which in Greek is called skēnopēgia) was to be done every year for seven days, that is, from the fifteenth day of the seventh month to the twenty-second. It is well worth our while to make a thorough examination of the mystery of this observance through spiritual investigation, especially since in the Gospel the Lord deigned to attend this same feast and, as he addressed the people who gathered there, dedicated it with his most holy words. Our ancestors too, therefore, were set free from slavery in Egypt through the blood of a lamb and were led through the desert for forty years that they come to the promised land when through the Lord’s passion the world was set free from slavery to the devil and through the apostles the primitive church was gathered and was led as it were through the desert for forty years until it came to the homeland promised in heaven, because in imitation of the forty-day fast that Moses and Elijah and the Lord himself fulfilled, the primitive church used to lead a life of great continence, thirsting always for its eternal homeland, and having set itself completely apart from all the distractions of this world, conducted its life as though in secret in daily meditation on the divine law. In remembrance of this time, we, too, ought to dwell in tabernacles, leaving our homes, that is, having forsaken the cares and pleasures of the world, we ought to confess that we are pilgrims in this life and have our homeland in heaven and desire that we may arrive there all the more quickly; this, too, in a holy feast in the seventh month (i.e., in the light of celestial joy) when the grace of the Holy Spirit, which was commended by the prophet as sevenfold, fills our heart. We are ordered to remain in these tabernacles for seven days because during the entire time of this life, which we accomplish in as many days, we must bear in mind that, like our ancestors, we are dwellers and pilgrims on earth in the eyes of the Lord.\n"

For it is written in Leviticus, “From the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in all the crops of your land, you shall celebrate a festival of the Lord for seven days; on the first day and on the eighth there will be a sabbath, that is, a day of rest. And on the first day you shall take for yourselves the fruits of the most beautiful tree,” and so on. Therefore, for the seven days of the Feast of Tabernacles, Ezra read to the people from the Book of the Law of God, doubtless because this is our true feast of the mind in this life—that each day (i.e., through all the good works by which we are illuminated by the Lord), we should make time for reading, hearing and performing his words with a resolute heart. But this feast begins “on the fifteenth day of the month when the moon is at its fullest in the evening,” when all the obscurities of our mind are dispersed by the most luminous light of Christ. And the eighth day of the sabbath (i.e., of rest) follows it, namely, at the moment of our resurrection in the life to come by whose joys in our present life we are uplifted in hope but that we will then enjoy in reality when the most longed-for gathering, the whole assembly of the saints (both of angels and of human beings), having been gathered in their Creator’s sight and never to be separated, will rejoice.\n"

From this example, I think, a most beautiful custom has developed in the church, namely, that through each hour of daily psalmody a passage from Old or New Testament is recited by heart for all to hear, and thus strengthened by the words of the apostles or the prophets, they bend their knees to perseverance in prayer, but also at night, when people cease from the labors of doing good works, they turn willing ears to listen to divine readings.\n"

But where he says at the end, “Because of all this, therefore, we ourselves are making a covenant and writing it down, and our leaders, our Levites and our priests are signing it,” and so on, it is shown more clearly with what gracious devotion all the various persons made a new assembly after the Feast of the Tabernacles, namely, so that after purging themselves with resolved purpose from the contagions of their wrongdoings, they might unite themselves to the divine covenant and confirm its terms by word and in writing. Thus separated from association with the ungodly, they would more confidently complete the work they began long ago, that is, to choose citizens from among the devout who were suitable to rebuild the city.\n"

Heretics and all enemies of the Church are also saddened whenever they notice the elect laboring for the catholic faith or the correction of morality so that the walls of the Church may be rebuilt. Note how different their mood and situation was now from what it had been earlier, because above it was said that those who had remained from the captivity in Judea were in great distress and disgrace,5 and that Nehemiah also conducted a prolonged fast with weeping and prayers because the walls of Jerusalem had been destroyed and its gates burned down by fire. But now, by contrast, the enemies of this same holy city were saddened and became greatly distressed because they realized that its buildings were about to be restored and at the same time that the citizens would be delivered from the insults of their enemies. Hence we should recollect that, even in this life, that saying of the Lord can be fulfilled in which he said, Amen Amen, I say unto you, that you will weep and mourn but the world will rejoice. 11151 You will grieve, he adds at once, but your grief will be turned into joy} For surely, as the world which used to rejoice weeps, the sadness of the just will be turned into joy when it is learnt that the affairs of the Holy Church are prospering and those who by sinning have gone astray are returning to her by doing penance.\n"

This accords with the parable of the house in the Gospel,1 whose builder dug deep and having removed a heap of earth, laid the foundations on rock which no onrush of waters or winds could throw down. For first we must remove from our heart the rubble of earthly desires and next build upon the foundation of faith the sturdy and invincible wall of good works, for whoever strives to erect an edifice of holy action on the rubble and debris of base thoughts is deceiving himself; and instead of a house or a city he will discover, as soon as a storm of temptation beats against it, that he has built a ruin.\n"

For it is a holy day of the Lord for us when we take pains to hear and carry out his words. On this day it is proper that, however much outwardly we have endured the obstacles of tribulations, we should be rejoicing in hope,2 in keeping with the Apostle's saying: As if sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.3 On this day we are commanded also to eat fat food and drink sweet drink - that is, to rejoice over the abundance of good action bestowed on us by God and over the very sweetness of hearing God's word. For sweet drink is wine sweetened with honey, which is why in Greek it is called O'IV6|JEàI. But from this same most healthful feast of our mind we are also instructed to send portions to him who did not prepare anything for himself, namely so that we take care to strengthen the weaker consciences of our neighbors either by the example of pious action or by the sweetness of devout advice, in order that their souls too might, according to the psalmist, be replenished with an abundance of heavenly blessing as though with fat and rich food5 and might praise the Lord's name with exulting lips. Now it behoves us to imitate this passage even in the literal sense, namely so that when on festival days, once our prayer, reading of the psalms, and studies are complete, we arrange to attend to the needs of the flesh with food, we should remember to give a portion also to paupers and pilgrims.\n"

Josephus, who spells his name 'Jaddus', says that he was the father of the high priest Onias,1 who is mentioned in the Book of Maccabees.2 This is not to say that Nehemiah, the author of this book, could have lived right up to those times in the flesh, but that he knew Jaddua when he was an infant, and Jaddua could have reached the rank of the priesthood long after Nehemiah's death. For at the end of this book too mention is made of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib, to the effect that one of these was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, though the name of this son-in-law is not recorded. But because this Joiada is the grandfather of Jaddua, it is clear that the son-in-law who is mentioned was either Jaddua's father or paternal uncle, and so he could have been born when Nehemiah was still alive.\n"

        "txt": "The arrangement was now completed. It was begun as soon as the city was made, but until the total number of the people had been counted and the feast of the seventh month had been completed, it was impossible to determine who should reside in the holy city itself and who in the other cities. Now it is consistent with the figures of the sacraments that the rulers of the people are reported to have settled in Jerusalem. For it is proper that those in charge of the holy church should surpass the common people in the merits of their life by as much as they surpass them in the greatness of their power. For the remaining cities of Israel represent the devout lifestyle of the common people of God, whereas the act of settling in Jerusalem specifically represents the conduct of those who, having already overcome the struggle of the vices, draw near to the vision of heavenly peace with an unimpeded mind according to the psalmist’s saying: “The Lord loves the gates of Zion above all the tabernacles of Jacob.” Thus it follows that the reason that a tenth part of the people chosen by lot take their dwelling in Jerusalem but the remaining nine parts reside in their cities is doubtless that it is a mark of the perfect (namely, of those who wholly keep the precepts of the Decalogue in the love of God and neighbor) to draw near in mind to the heavenly secrets and, so to speak, to imitate the peace of the highest blessedness amid the whirlwinds of this transient life; and yet the door to eternal life also remains open to those who keep God’s general commandments, according to what the Lord declares in the Gospel to the rich man who questioned him. For such people dwell as it were in cities given to them by the Lord because by keeping the sacred law they remain constantly vigilant to defend themselves from the attacks of the ancient enemy. But those who wish to be perfect and follow the Lord by selling all their belongings and giving them as alms for the poor are those who dwell as it were “in the citadel of Jerusalem” and next to the temple of God and the ark of the covenant because they approach the grace of their Creator in a more sublime way. It is well said that their dwelling in the holy city was granted to them not by the foresight of human choice but by the outcome of a lot, just as during Joshua’s time the ownership of the rest of the cities was given to the children of Israel by lot, no doubt because both the small things of the small man and the great things of the great man come about not through the freedom or industriousness of his own will but by the gift of the hidden judge and provider.\n"

Similarly, it is fitting for spiritual teachers also to get up regularly at night and inspect with careful scrutiny the state of the Holy Church while others are resting, so that they might vigilantly investigate how they might repair and rebuild through chastening those things which have been defiled or destroyed in it by the warfare of sins.3 Jerusalem's wall lies in ruins, and the way of life of the faithful is soiled by earthly and base desires. The gates are consumed by fire when, as a result of their abandoning instruction in the truth, even those who ought to have been opening up the entrance of life to others also by teaching them now grow idle with the same laziness as everyone else and  become slaves to temporal concerns.\n"

For the unwearied enemy lies in waiting with his unclean companions (namely /750/ malicious spirits and people) who constantly endeavor to impede and, in so far as they can, to assault the works of the faith and virtues whenever we are incautious, and they attempt to kill the mind of the faithful with the sword of depraved suggestion. But against these we must, according to the Apostle, take up the armor of God so that we may be able to resist on the evil day and to stand perfect in all things? Now is it well said that he stationed the people behind the wall in a circuit with weapons so that, surrounded by a troop of armed men, the builders might press on in building the wall with a freer and securer hand. For the grades of the faithful are divided up: some build up the Church by adorning it with good works on the inside, while others, armed with the weapons of sacred reading, keep vigilant for heretics who attack the same Church.1 The former in religious devotion strengthen their neighbors in the truth of the faith, while the latter wage a necessary battle against the weapons of the devil or of the vices with which they struggle to assault this same faith, and with pastoral solicitude repel the wolves lying in ambush from the Lord's sheepfold. “Neh. 4:15” And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it had been reported to us, God frustrated their counsel, and we all returned to the walls, each man to his own work. In the spiritual edifice too, if we are always clothed with the apostolic armour,2 the stratagem of the devil and his angels who desire to subdue us will be foiled.\n"

Finally, the cities of the descendants of Benjamin are recounted in a similar order, and the sentence that is added after they have been counted, “And of the Levites portions of Judah and Benjamin,” means that the Levites according to the decree of the Law received a lot on the property of the descendants of Judah and Benjamin. Let this much be said briefly concerning the historical sense. Concerning all these matters, if it delights you to hear also some allegorical meaning that is appropriate for our actions, Judah is interpreted as “he who confesses,” Benjamin “the son of the right hand” and Levi “accepted.” The reason that the tribes of all of these dwell partly in Jerusalem and partly in cities given to them by God is that the stages of progress of the faithful are many and diverse, and for them there are also many mansions in our Father’s house in heaven, as we have taught above. Some are content to observe God’s general commandments: not to commit murder, not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to speak false testimony against a neighbor, to honor father and mother, and to love neighbors as themselves. Others try to lay hold of the narrower stronghold of the perfect life, yet they all, each person according to his own calling, praise and confess the grace of their Creator, and they are children of the everlasting kingdom that is in his right hand and are taken up by him to life when the moment of that separation will come in which “two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left behind.

Once these have been set forth, there are also added those who, from this time until the beginning of the kingdom of the Macedonians, succeeded each other in turn in the leadership of the priesthood. For there follows “Jeshua begot Joiakim, Joiakim begot Elijahhib, Elijahhib begot Joiada, Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jaddua.” In fact, Josephus writes that Jaddua, who was the last of these, was the high priest in the time of Alexander the Great, and when Jaddua with his brothers met him, Alexander received him humbly and with honor. Josephus, who spells his name Jaddus, says that he was the father of the high priest Onias, who is mentioned in the book of Maccabees. This not to say that Nehemiah, the author of this book, could have lived right up to that time in the flesh but that he knew Jaddua when he was an infant, and Jaddua could have reached the rank of priesthood long after Nehemiah’s death. For at the end of this book mention also is made of the sons of Joiada son of Elijahhib, to the effect that one of these was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, though the name of his son-in-law is not recorded. But because this Joiada is the grandfather of Jaddua, it is clear that the son-in-law who is mentioned was either Jaddua’s father or parental uncle, and so he could have been born when Nehemiah was still alive.\n"

No one can doubt that in the same sequence, this takes place in the spiritual building too when, as the hour of final retribution approaches as though it were the long-desired dedication of God’s city, the faithful obtain eternal rewards for their works when, much like Nehemiah and Ezra and the other priests and Levites as they each bring forth their workers, all the teachers of faithful peoples conduct their listeners whom they have acquired for the Lord into the fortifications of the heavenly homeland. Then, as well as the other fortifications of the holy city, Nehemiah also walks with his choir of praisers over the Tower of the Ovens in whose structure they once used to sweat, when teachers of the truth rejoice over the sublime rewards of those whom they have taught. For if the loaves of the furnace that are baked in secret signify the inward devotion of the mind of the faithful that is strengthened by the fire of love, which is why such loaves were also commanded by the Law to be offered as a sacrifice to the Lord, what could be more aptly figured by the ovens in which these loaves are baked than their very hearts that are accustomed always to burn with the flame of inner love and to beget deeds or words of the virtues?\n"

We know that the Valley of Jehoshaphat, which was also called Gehinnom (that is, the Valley of Hinnom), lies toward the eastern side of the city of Jerusalem, through which the brook of Kidron (of which mention is made in the gospel) flows from north to south when it takes in water from snow or rain. But we read that the Valley of Gihon is in the west of this same city, as the book of the Chronicles states concerning King Manasseh of Judah, as was mentioned above: After this he built a wall outside of the City of David, to the west of Gihon in the valley. Now Gihon is the name of the spring where Solomon was anointed king outside the city.4 Therefore, whether in this passage Ezra means this or that or another valley of this same city, the mystical meaning is clear, namely that the Valley Gate is built in Jerusalem when either the elect who recently have been imbued with knowledge of the faith, or those who had gone astray but have been restored in the purity of the faith, are ordered by teachers of the truth to observe among other things the virtue of humility so that they may deserve to be raised up by the greater grace of God, for as Sacred Scripture says, God resists the proud, but bestows his grace on the humble, and in a psalm: and the valleys will abound with wheat, i.e. the humble will abound with the gifts of heavenly refection. And it is well that the Valley Gate is built after the Old Gate and the Broad Wall, no doubt because after the rudiments of catholic faith which are demonstrated through love, we must be taught to observe humility, which is the guardian of the virtues,1 so that according to the precept of the wise man, the greater we are, the more we should humble ourselves in all things.\n"

But the vessels of Tobiah the Ammonite are also cast out from the temple storeroom, and God’s vessels as well as the sacrifice and the incense are returned to that place by those who, after they have excommunicated or anathematized heretics and false catholics and expelled them from the church, substitute in their place catholic servants of Christ such as may serve him faithful deeds and prayers.
