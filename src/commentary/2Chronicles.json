Two things now, you see, should be in one who prays: asking earnestly and asking what he ought, “since you too,” said he, “though you are parents, wait for your children to ask; and if they should ask of you anything inexpedient, you refuse the gifts; just as, if it be expedient, you consent and bestow it.” Do you too, considering these things, not withdraw until you receive; until you have found, do not retire; do not relax your diligence until the door is opened. For if you approach with this mind and say, “Except I receive, I will not depart,” you will surely receive, provided you ask such things as are both suitable for him of whom you asked to give and expedient for you the petitioner. But what are these? To seek the things spiritual, all of them; to forgive them who have trespassed, and so to draw near asking forgiveness; “to lift up holy hands without wrath and doubting.” If we thus ask, we shall receive. As it is, surely our asking is a mockery and the act of drunken rather than of sober people.“What then,” said one, “if I ask even spiritual things, and do not receive?” You did not surely knock with earnestness; or you made yourself unworthy to receive; or did quickly stop asking.\n“And wherefore,” it may be inquired, “did he not say, what things we ought to ask”? No, truly, he has mentioned them all in what precedes and has signified for what things we ought to draw near. Do not say, then, “I drew near and did not receive.” For in no case is it owing to God that we receive not, God who loves us so much as to surpass even parents, to surpass them as far as goodness does this evil nature.\n"

Now the subject of God is harder to come at, in proportion as it is more perfect than any other and is open to more objections, and the solutions of them are more laborious. For every objection, however small, stops and hinders the course of our argument and cuts off its further advance, just like people who suddenly check with the rein the horses in full career and turn them right round by the unexpected shock. Thus Solomon, who was the wisest of all people, whether before him or in his own time, to whom God gave breadth of heart and a flood of contemplation, more abundant than the sand, even he, the more he entered into the depth, the more dizzy he became, and he declared the furthest point of wisdom to be the discovery of how very far off it was from him.\n"

But the more each one labors in giving his neighbors support in their needs or in correcting their mistakes, the more surely may he expect in the life to come the rewards whether of peace of soul after death or of blessed immortality of body. Consequently, the aforesaid overseers are rightly recorded as numbering 70, and 80,000: 70, because of the sabbath rest of souls for the seventh day is consecrated to the sabbath, that is, rest; 80, because of the hope of resurrection on the eighth day, that is, after the sabbath, has already taken place in the Lord, and, it is hoped, will take place in us also on the eighth day and in the eighth age to come. The overseers, on the other hand, were 3,300, doubtless because of faith in the holy Trinity that the holy Scriptures proclaim to us. But the fact that in the book of Paralipomenon the number 3, is written instead of 3, has to do with the very same perfection of people of sublime virtue. For because the Lord completed the adornment of the world in the number six, the perfect works of good people are rightly apt to be symbolized by the same number, and because holy Scripture teaches that we must have the works of piety as well as true faith, the overseers of the temple works are rightly said to be 3,600. Nor should we pass over the fact that these 70, and 80, hod carriers and stonemasons with their overseers were not from Israel but from among the proselytes, that is, strangers who sojourned among them. For it is written in the book of Paralipomenon, “And Solomon took a census of all the proselytes resident in the land of Israel, on the model of the census that David his father had taken; and it was found that they numbered 153,600. And he put 70, of them carrying burdens on their shoulders,” and so forth.\n"

I will listen to you, as to a holy people. [2 Chronicles 7:14] And in another place He speaks thus: \"Wash you and become clean; put away the wickedness of your souls from before my eyes; cease from your evil ways, and learn to do well; seek out judgment, deliver the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and see that justice is done to the widow; and come, and let us reason together. He declares, Though your sins be like crimson, I will make them white as snow; though they be like scarlet, I will whiten them like wool. And if you be willing and obey me, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you refuse, and will not hearken unto me, the sword shall devour you, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.\" [Isaiah 1:16-20] Desiring, therefore, that all His beloved should be partakers of repentance, He has, by His almighty will, established [these declarations].\n"

        "txt": "War. The author of the new edition of St. Jerome mentions two manuscripts and there are several printed editions, which reduce these numbers to one half. Castalio adopts this correction, asserting that the Greek and Josephus are on his side, which is not true. (Calmet) \nWe must however observe, that there is some doubt with respect to Josephus, (Haydock) as some of the oldest Latin editions acknowledge the smaller numbers; and Vignoles (i. 29.) conjectures, that the Greek copies did the same formerly, since Aborbanel \"accuses Josephus of having made Jeroboam's loss no more than 50,000, contrary to the Hebrew text \"ver. 17. This learned author is of opinion, that the Jews sometimes expressed their numbers by figures, (Kennicott) analogous to those which the later Arabs borrowed from the Indians; though, in more ancient times, the letters of the alphabet had been used. Both customs seem to have prevailed; (Erpenius) and this may account for many variations, as the omission of a single cypher, resembling our period (.), might easily occasion much confusion. Kennicott (Diss. i., and ii.) seems to suspect, that the ancient versions have been made to agree with the corrupted Hebrew, no less than Josephus; and that many of the large numbers, recorded in Scripture, (which might countenance what we here read) are incorrect. See chap. xvii. 13, 19., and xiv. 8., comp. with 4 Kings xiii. 7. It is certain (Haydock) many Latin manuscripts confirm the edition of Sixtus V, which has the smaller numbers; and this is the case with most of the older manuscripts and editions. How St. Jerome expressed it, we cannot easily determine. The editor of his works has been guided chiefly by the Memmian canon. See 2 Kings xv. 7. Lyranus quotes St. Jerome, as reading 50,000; (ver. 7) and it is so expressed in the Paris editions of 1534 and (Haydock) 1546, of the Hebrew questions on Paralipomenon. But Erasmus doubts whether this be the genuine work of St. Jerome, (Kennicott) or in the state in which he left it. If we consult the more ancient manuscripts and editions, prior to that of Clement VIII, we shall allow that they are more favourable to the smaller numbers, on this occasion; and are more likely to exhibit the pure version of the holy doctor, (Haydock) as the later editions have had \"the Hebrew fountains \"also in view. (Kennicott) \nIf however we adhere to the received numbers, (Haydock) we must remember that kings, at that time, led forth to battle all their subjects who were able to bear arms. Under Moses there were 600,000. David found 1,100,000 in Israel, and 470,000 in Juda, exclusive of Levi and Benjamin; (chap. xxi. 5.) or, at least, as it is expressed 2 Kings xxiv. 9., in all, 1,300,000. Asa was at the head of 580,000, chap. xiv. 8.\n"

We read that Baasa died in the 26th year of Asa, 3 Kings xvi. 8. How then could he fight with him in the 36th? (Tirinus) \nRama was on an eminence, and commanded the pass below. Baasa wished to cut off all communication with the kingdom of Juda, as he knew many of his subjects had emigrated for the sake of the true religion, chap. xv. 9. (Calmet) \nHe had taken the city from the tribe of Benjamin. (Tirinus) Ver. 3. There is, Hebrew is indeterminate: \"a league \"Septuagint, \"Make a league. Behold I have sent thee gold and silver. Come and drive away from me Baasa, king \"\nThat. Protestants, \"go, break thy league. \"(Haydock) \nAsa induces the king of Damascus to act perfidiously. (Calmet) \nOtherwise it is not unlawful to make use of the arms of infidels, unless where God has forbidden it. (Grotius, Jur. ii. 15, 9.) (Masius in Jos. ix. 15.) \nDavid had recourse to Achis, and the Machabees to the Romans. (Calmet) \nSome kings are blamed for making leagues with the princes of Israel, because they had been warned to the contrary; and Asa was severely reprehended, as he had already received such assurances of the divine protection, (chap. xiv. 12., and xv. 7.) that nothing but pusillanimity could have induced him (Haydock) to give away the sacred treasures, in order to obtain this aid of the Syrian king, ver. 7. Ver. 4. Nephthali. This seem preferable to the Hebrew reading, 3 Kings xv. 20. (Calmet) \nProtestants, \"all the store-cities. \"Septuagint, \"all the environs. \"(Haydock) \nArabic, \"all the arsenals of the cities of Nephthali. \"Ver. 7. Syria. It seems more natural to read Israel. (Calmet) \nBut we must remember that Benadad was an ally of Israel; and if he had not been bribed, he would have come to the assistance of Baasa, (Haydock) and thus both might have fallen a prey to Asa, as the much greater forces of Zara had done. (Tirinus) Ver. 9. Behold. Protestants, \"run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him. \"Septuagint, \"to show power in every heart full, or perfect, in his regard. \"(Haydock) \nAsa fell on this occasion through human frailty, but rose again by repentance. \nThee, as they were till the death of Baasa, 3 Kings xv. 32. Ver. 10. Prison. Literally, \"in bonds \"(nervum) made of leather thongs or nerves, (Haydock) or of iron, to confine either the neck or the feet. (Isidor. orig. 5. ultra) \nHebrew, \"the house of disturbance. \"Septuagint, \"prison. \"Some explain it (Calmet) of the stocks to enclose the neck. (Vatable) \nTime, either because they expressed the same sentiments as the prophet, (Calmet) or because they disapproved of his imprisonment.

Most Hebrew, \"till his disease got upwards \"(Calmet) to the head (Tirinus) and heart, (Haydock) when the gout generally proves fatal. (Cornelius a Lap ide) \nSeptuagint, \"till he was very ill: \"(Haydock) a just punishment for his having confined the prophet in fetters; but of a temporal nature, as he sinned through passion, and died penitent, his heart being perfect (chap. xv. 17.) all or the most part of his days, particularly in the last. (Worthington) \nRather. Hebrew and Septuagint simply, \"physicians. \"(Haydock) \nYet it was not the having recourse to them, with some degree of confidence, that is here reprehended, but the placing too much trust in men, (Calmet) and too little in God, the sovereign arbiter of life and death. (Haydock) Ver. 14. Sepulchre. Hebrew, \"sepulchres \"as there were many separate apartments in the same cavern. (Calmet) \nAsa had prepared one cell, as David and Solomon had done.

It denotes a mixture of perfumes. (Menochius) \nBut here the Vulgate read zunim. (Du Hamel) \nHebrew and Septuagint, \"they laid him on a bed, and filled it with aromatical spices, and with various sorts of perfumers' ointments, and they made him a very great funeral, or (Haydock) burning. \"(Protestants) \nIt is not clear whether the body was placed on a bed of state, and these perfumes were used to remove every disagreeable smell, or the body itself was rather consumed along with them, a practice which seems to have become more common since the days of Asa, Jeremias xxxiv. 5., 1 Kings xxxi. 12., and Amos vi. 10. Joram was deprived of this honour, chap. xxi. 19. (Calmet) \nSanctius adduces many examples, to prove that the spices were burnt only near the body; (Tirinus) and the Hebrews generally preferred to inter the corpse.

And yet, was it not of their own will that the Philistines and Arabs came to lay waste the country of Judah? Or did they so come of their own will that the Scripture lies where it tells us that the Lord stirred up their spirit to do so? On the contrary. Both statements are true because they did come of their own will and God did stir up their spirit. The same thing could also be expressed by saying that God both stirred up their spirit and that they came nevertheless of their own will.

For Joash the king of Judah at the age of seven was summoned by Jehoiada the priest to the kingdom and by the witness of Scripture is commended for all his actions as long as the aforesaid priest lived. But hear what Scripture relates of him after Jehoiada’s death and how he was puffed up with pride and given over to a most disgraceful state. “But after the death of Jehoiada the princes went in and worshiped the king: and he was soothed by their services and hearkened to them. And they forsook the temple of the Lord, the God of their fathers, and served groves and idols, and great wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem because of this sin.” And after a little: “When a year was come about, the army of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the princes of the people, and they sent all the spoils to the king to Damascus. And whereas there came a very small number of the Syrians, the Lord delivered into their hands an infinite multitude, because they had forsaken the Lord the God of their fathers; and on Joash they executed shameful judgments. And departing they left him in great diseases.” You see how the consequence of pride was that he was given over to shocking and filthy passions. For he who is puffed up with pride and has permitted himself to be worshiped as God, is (as the apostle says) “given over to shameful passions and a reprobate mind to do those things that are not convenient.” And because, as Scripture says, “everyone who exalts his heart is unclean before God,” he who is puffed up with swelling pride of heart is given over to most shameful confusion to be deluded by it, that when thus humbled he may know that he is unclean through impurity of the flesh and knowledge of impure desires, a thing that he had refused to recognize in the pride of his heart; and also that the shameful infection of the flesh may disclose the hidden impurity of the heart, which he contracted through the sin of pride, and that through the patent pollution of his body he may be proved to be impure, who did not formerly see that he had become unclean through the pride of his spirit.\n"

Now, how does the power of God help some in war by giving them confidence and put others to flight by injecting fear into them, except it be that he who has made all things according to his own will, in heaven and on earth, also works in human hearts? We read also what Joash, king of Israel, said when he sent a message to Amaziah, king of Judah, who wanted to fight with him. After certain other words, he added, “Now stay at home; why do you challenge me to your hurt, that you should fall, you and Judah with you?” Then the Scripture has added this sequel: “But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might be delivered into their hands, because they sought after the gods of Edom.” Behold, now, how God, wishing to punish the sin of idolatry, wrought this in this man’s heart, with whom he was indeed justly angry, not to listen to sound advice but to despise it and go to the battle in which he with his army was routed.\n"

But Josephus carefully studied the additional comments of the expounders as well, and a Hebrew of the Hebrews as he was, hear his description of the events of those times. He tells: “Though the priests urged Uzziah to go out of the temple and not to break the law of God, he angrily threatened them with death unless they held their peace. And meanwhile an earthquake shook the earth, and a bright light shone through a breach in the temple and struck the king’s face, so that at once it became leprous. And before the city at the place called Eroga, the western half of the Mount was split asunder and rolling four stadia stopped at the eastern mountain, so as to block up the royal approach and gardens.” This I take from the work of Josephus on Jewish antiquities. And I found in the beginning of the prophet Amos the statement that he began to prophecy “in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, two years before the earthquake.” What earthquake he does not clearly say. But I think the same prophet further on suggests this earthquake when he says, “I saw the Lord standing on the altar. And he said, Strike the altar, and the doors shall be shaken, and strike the heads of all, and the remnant I will slay with the sword.”Here I understand a prediction of the earthquake, and of the destruction of the ancient solemnities of the Jewish race and of the worship practiced by them in Jerusalem, the ruin that should overtake them after the coming of our Savior, when, since they rejected the Christ of God, the true High Priest, leprosy infected their souls, as in the days of Uzziah, when the Lord himself standing on the altar gave leave to him that struck, saying, “Strike the altar.”\n"

It is read in the books of the Chronicles, “Also in Judah, the hand of God was made to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes in the word of the Lord.” … Did the men of God who wrote these things—in fact, did the Spirit of God himself, under whose guidance such things were written by them—assail human free will? Away with the notion! But God has commended both the most righteous judgment and the most merciful aid of the Omnipotent in all cases. For it is enough for human beings to know that there is no unrighteousness with God. But how he dispenses those benefits, making some deservedly vessels of wrath, others graciously vessels of mercy—who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? If, then, we attain to the honor of grace, let us not be ungrateful by attributing to ourselves what we have received. “For what do we have which we have not received?”?\n"

And wrath was kindled against him and against Judah and Jerusalem. He humbled himself afterwards because his heart had been proud, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and therefore the wrath of the Lord did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.” How dangerous, how terrible is the malady of vanity! So much goodness, so many virtues, faith and devotion, great enough to prevail to change nature itself and the laws of the whole world—all destroyed by a single act of pride! The result would have been that all his good deeds would have been forgotten as if they had never existed, and he would at once have been subject to the wrath of the Lord unless he had appeased him by recovering his humility. Thus, he who, at the suggestion of pride, had fallen from so great a height of excellence, could only mount again to the height he had lost by the same steps of humility.\n"

For he did not lose the title of just because he committed small sins, but he possessed the title of just because he performed many good deeds. Say all this to prove, with the testimonies of sacred Scripture, that the just are not sinners simply because they have sinned on occasions, but they remain just because they flourish in many virtues. Of Josiah it is written, “He did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of David his father. He declined neither to the right nor to the left”; and yet, although he was a just man, in a time of need and dire necessity, he sent Hilkiah to Huldah, the prophet, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. “And she dwelled,” he says, “in Jerusalem in the second part” (a reference, undoubtedly, to that part of the city that is enclosed by an inner wall). “And she answered, ‘Thus says the Lord the God of Israel: Go and tell the man that sent you to me.’ ” There is contained in these words a secret reproof of the king and priests and all men, because never was there any saint found among people who could predict the future.\n"

In fact Zachariah is punished with dumbness, Job is condemned out of his own mouth, and Jehoshaphat and Josiah who are beyond a doubt described as righteous are narrated to have done things displeasing to the Lord. The first aligned himself with the ungodly Ahab and brought on himself the rebuke of Micaiah; and the second, though forbidden by the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, went against Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, and was killed by him.\n"
