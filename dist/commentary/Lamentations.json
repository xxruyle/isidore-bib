        "txt": "As this opening verse states: \"She that was great among the nations,\" that is, once subject to her. As Ezekiel 5:5 declares: \"This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the center of the nations.\"\n\nThen is displayed that the people's glory was once distinguished by their tributes. For: \"she that was a princess among the cities has become a vassal\" Because, once tributes were made to her. As 2 Samuel 8:2 declares: \"and he (David) defeated Moab.\" And the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.\n\nAnd, King Solomon had divided his kingdom within such glories, as setting forth distinctive projects to single cities. As recorded in I Kings 4:21: \"Solomon ruled over all the kingdom from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; they brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.\" Also Proverbs l2:21 states: \"The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be put to forced labor.\"\n\nNow to this Verse 1 is applied the first letter of the Hebrew, \"Aleph\", since doctrine is indicated. This Verse 1 points out to the Hebrew people the exact doctrine from God that lacks their observance, within their own knowledge, as people within captivity. This fact the prophet Isaiah 5:13 underscores: \"Therefore my people go into exile for want of knowledge; their honored men are dying of hunger, and their multitude is parched with thirst.\"\n\nIt must be also known that a fourth place of conquest is applicable in many colors, and in parched places: within this first lamentation.\n\nNow, allegorically, \"the city\", in Verse 1 is the present church. The phrase: \"that was full of people!\" is indicative of the various tributes. And: \"she was great among the nations\" denotes obedi ence to the faith. Finally: \"she what was a princess among the cities has become a vassal\". This can refer to diversity within the Church, as discerned by a life-style prevailing.\n\nThen again \"How lonely sits the city that was full of people.\" This can indicate a loss of protection and aid from angels. And, \"How like a widow has she become \". Namely, as she is taken away from her present spouse. Finally: \"has become a vassal\". That is, exposed to tyrants.\n\nMorally, the phrase: \"sits the city\", connotes the human soul. And, the phrase, \"that was full of people, indicates people of good affection.\n\nThen, the saying, \"great among the nations\". Namely, regards corruptions. Also: \"princess among the cities\". That is, as to the human senses.\n\nThen again: \"How lonely\": away from suffrages of goods. And, \"like a widow\". As to embraces of a husband. Finally : \"has become a vassal\": to corruptions.\n"

        "txt": "ALEPH: ‘doctrine’, that man may know both himself and God. This, the Jewish people did not have and were thus subject to the enemies.\n\nHow does the city sit solitary: He proclaims that the overthrow of the poor city and the fall of the crooked people not only took place under the Chaldeans, but were to be fulfilled to even greater extent under Titus and Vespasian. In fact, before the final captivity, she is not rightly said to be sitting alone, if not perhaps due to some exaggeration of pain. They are said to have been left by the Chaldeans as poor cultivators of the land, over whom Godolias is put in charge, and the city is not entirely destroyed, but is, after the death of Christ, dispersed to become desolated, so that neither stone upon stone, nor the people, shall be left in her. For against them, returned from captivity, grew the rod of anger, since they were not turned towards the Lord through the prophets’ admonitions and reproofs, but had always been ungrateful to the mercies of God. Hence Moses: For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck, you have always been rebellious against the Lord, and Stephanus said: You stiff-necked &c. Therefore, although often torn by the lashes of the scourge, overpowered by the enemies, afflicted by every evil, they believed not, but provoked the most high God. So, with ten tribes already captured in Assyria, the two that had remained, following David home and worshiping God according to their kind, eventually, with malevolence increasing, were for the first time captured in Chaldea, wherefore the city is here lamented: How doth the city sit solitary.\n\nGilbert. Albeit I say nothing, the careful reader will not pass in silence over the splendor of the rhetorical colors, the weight of the sentences and the adornment of speech. For nothing, he will also find the multitude of heads of rhetoric, the choice dialectic and the plainness of the arguments. Moreover, he will teach, without instruction, the abjectness of the rhetorical complaint (conquestio), and occasionally the severity of disdain (indignatio), or the combination of both. To satisfy the unskilled, however, I shall not unwillingly explain the rhetorical complaint and disdain by their proper definitions.\n\n‘Complaint’, as Tully says, ‘is speech seeking to arouse the pity of the audience’. Its first head is that by which we show what prosperity we once enjoyed and what misery we are in now, as it is here: How doth the city sit solitary &c.\n\n‘Disdain is speech by which either hatred is aroused against some person or offense at some event’; the first head of which is from authority, when it is related of how much concern this event has been to the immortal gods &c. As it is said here: Her Nazarites were whiter than snow &c.\n\nIn the first alphabet I therefore show the more careful, penetrating reader the right way by denoting a few heads of complaint and disdain &c.\n\nHistorical interpretation. HOW DOTH THE CITY SIT SOLITARY: that is to say Jerusalem, deprived of its people, full of disgrace, humiliated among her enemies, once populous and glorious among her enemies; THE MISTRESS OF THE GENTILES IS BECOME AS A WIDOW, deserted by her kings, forsaken by her priests, the temple profaned and the glory of the vessels repudiated, deprived of God’s assistance; THE MISTRESS OF THE GENTILES, whom she before had overthrown or forced under the yoke.\n\nAllegorical interpretation. The Church is to be lamented with more tears than her sins require, being made a WIDOW due to the absence of her spouse. HOW DOTH THE CITY SIT SOLITARY, forsaken by the assistance of God and the angels! If the bridegroom were together with the bride, the bride need not be mourned for, since the children of the bridegroom cannot mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them, but they rejoice with joy because of the bridegroom’s voice, but when they noticed that their mother, that is to say the Church, had been widowed from the bridegroom, it was fit that not only the sons cry, but also all their friends. Hence Jeremiah deplored more than everyone and on behalf of everyone not the ruin of boulders but of men.\n\nHOW DOTH THE CITY SIT SOLITARY: this shows the disposition of the crying, hence, for the mourner’s emotion to be expressed, also Job is said to have sat on a dunghill, who himself is interpreted ‘mourning’. Of this captivity it is said: Upon the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and cried. Namely we, who did not want to stand in the throne of the kingdom and in the supreme height of heaven; by rights we wail when we sit on the rivers of temptation, whence Isaiah: Come down, sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne for the daughter of the Chaldeans. Thus, for our Jerusalem, when she has landed in the shame of her sins, there is no throne of dignity, but she is defiled with mortal offenses, whence Jeremiah laments, not only because of her being contaminated with worldly undertakings, but because she sits SOLITARY, and solitary because she is AS A WIDOW, and a widow because she is deserted by her spouse for the sake of the ugliness of her nefarious actions. AS A WIDOW, not really a widow, namely, for if she at times is despised by the bridegroom, nevertheless the rights of matrimony are retained, so that, if she should wish to return by means of penitence, she would recover her spouse, when she has made satisfaction, and the raiment of immortality, clad anew in which she will yield to the tribute of no one. Hence St Paul: Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.\n\nMoral interpretation. The soul SITS SOLITARY AS A WIDOW, divested of the goods of virtue, since she has submitted herself to the lordship of the Chaldeans and defied the spouse of her youth. The Chaldeans are interpreted ‘they who take captive’; they are demons, who recall the soul from the seat of the heavenly fatherland and capture it in their power. Hence: Get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans. Since, namely, you, daughter of God, refused to stay in the light of virtue, go, change your name and enter into the shadows of blindness! Hence Jeremiah exclaims with sighs: HOW DOTH THE CITY SIT SOLITARY, that is to say the soul, once full of virtues and approbations of the saints as A CITY FULL OF PEOPLE, now desolate, she who previously, among the throngs of friends, was mighty by divine aid, now sits wretched among enemies. For her there is no fellowship with the saints, no communion with the sacraments, no partaking with her spouse, but she is brought back to pay tribute to vices. Hence: My father left me subject to many creditors, whom, even if I should labor every day, I would not satisfy. Many are the tributes to offense, to which the soul is subject, until it, through penitence, returns to liberty. Hence: Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. Thus follows the voice of the one lamenting: WEEPING SHE HAS WEPT IN THE NIGHT.\n"

        "txt": "St. Paschasius. There are Canticles of Canticles; there are also Lamentations of Lamentations.\nThe book of Solomon is called the ‘Canticles of Canticles’, Jeremiah’s Threni the\n‘Lamentations of Lamentations’. For as the Canticles excel, in which the\nbridegroom or the bride enjoys sweet embraces, so do the Lamentations, in\nwhich the bridegroom’s absence from the bride is deplored by many ways of\nweeping, whence it is said: How doth the city sit solitary &c. In those Canticles,\nseveral persons are introduced to wedding bliss; in these Lamentations, many\nare deplored who have been taken away. Canticles are proper in the heavenly\nfatherland, lamentations in this life’s misery. Therefore, David says: A hymn\nbecomes You in Zion, O God, and elsewhere: Blessed is the man whose help is from thee;\nin his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps, in the vale of tears, in the place which he hath\nset.\n\n\nSt. Paschasius. He laments by means of a fourfold alphabet, as both we and the world\nconsist of four elements - fire, air, water, earth - in order that we who are\nmade of four elements, should grieve by way of four alphabets. That the\nprophet laments not only the present, but also the future and the past, the\nBook of Proverbs reveals, where you read that the entire Judea and Jerusalem\nmourned Joshua, and Jeremiah in particular.\n\n\nBeneath the four cardinal directions he laments by means of a fourfold\nalphabet the trespasses of the present world, inviting everyone to wailing. For\nthis number is material, since both man and the world are composed of four\nelements. Four are the seasons, four the climates; our age likewise consists of\nfour parts: both of the day, the week, the month and the year. Therefore this number, somehow material and square and solid, matches everything with\nitself, not only worldly things, but also celestial, so that they will stand firm.\nFour are the evangelists, four the excellent virtues, whence the others originate,\nby which, as by the four rivers of paradise, all the germs of virtue are watered.\nSince, therefore, we, who do wrong within and without, consist of four\nelements, it is just that we together with the prophet lament in a fourfold\nnumber, and by means of a material number renew ourselves inside and\noutside, that the single wailing of the letters should be opposed to the single\ndegradations of morals and bodies, that we, who are held captive upon the rivers\nof Babylon, absolved by penitence and grace, shall enjoy true liberty in our own\nZion.\n\n\nSt. Paschasius. It is an accepted fact that there are many kinds of wailing, many diversities\nof tears. We bemoan our own detriment differently from another’s. In one way\nwe lament owing to our yearning for the heavenly fatherland, in another way\nbecause of the immensity of our offenses and in dread of hell. We lament\ndifferently on account of the distress of heart than we do of love for pious\nrecollection. Divine Scripture explains these diversities of weeping in different\nplaces, when it describes the various passions and lamentations of individuals.\nHence David: My tears have been my bread day and night &c, and elsewhere: I have\nlabored in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed: I will water my couch with my\ntears. And Jeremiah: My eye is troubled through indignation &c. The faithful are\nmoved by these passions, who have recalled to their minds that whole volume\nof Ezekiel, in which there had been written lamentations and songs and woe.\n\n\n\nSt. Paschasius. In Lamentations, we have decided to expound the ruin of the earthly city as\nwell as the forfeit of the Church and the hazard of souls and, owing to the\nsuitability of the passages, direct the meanings according to three times.\n\n\n\nThe Threni, as St Jerome says, were in Hebrew composed by means of the\nrules of metre. Hence, in Latin, the single Hebrew letters, with which, in\nHebrew, every verse takes its beginning, are put before every separate sentence,\nand not so many letters lack mystical sense, since not one tittle, nor one jot of the\nlaw shall pass away. Thus, the understanding of every single letter should be\nadapted to every single sentence.\n\n\nAleph is interpreted as ‘doctrine’. The true doctrine is, however, that by\nwhich God is known and the state or weakness of each and everyone is not\nignored. Hence Isaiah: Glorify ye the Lord in instruction. Then Jeremiah, in a spirit\nof grief, says: How doth the city sit solitary &c. He does not lament the walls of the\ncity but, figuratively, his people taken into captivity. Hence Isaiah: And the\ndaughter Zion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,\nand as a city that is laid waste. This is a forceful prophet’s outcry, full of wailing,\nfull of pain, full of astonishment and dismay.\n\n\nGilbert. It is manifest that the Lamentations of Jeremiah are in a special way\npunctuated by the clause of speech, or colored by means of asyndeton. For\nthe case is said to be briefly completed without a presentation of the whole\nsentence, which is succeeded by another clause of the speech, as this is: Weeping\nshe has wept in the night &c. Occasionally, by way of asyndeton, connecting\nparticles are removed, separate parts are brought forth in this fashion: How doth\nthe city sit solitary &c, and in a rhetorical manner the speech sometimes consists\nof two clauses, sometimes of three or more.\n\n\nSt. Paschasius. A lamentation is a compunction, infused by the gift of the Holy Ghost in\nthe hearts of men, either due to moaning over the present life or yearning for\nthe everlasting. We read David’s laments over Saul and Jonathan and over\nAbsalon. Ezekiel wept with much weeping, Peter cried bitterly. But these are justly\ncalled the ‘Lamentations of Lamentations’ and so extend genus to species, as\nsometimes species is extended to genus. So the ruin of the earthly Jerusalem\nand of the people are deplored, that the detriments of the present Church may\nbe bewailed. So the new people’s community with the old, who, dashing from\nthe faith, are being captured, is lamented, as is the ruin of each and everyone’s\nsoul, which used to be the temple of the Holy Spirit. So Lamentations allude\nto the present captivity, under which this prophecy takes place, that the\ncaptivity under Titus and Vespasian may not be entirely forgotten. Finally the\nprophet, considering all the adversities and ruins of present life both wails and\nmoans individual things, so that the individuals may learn to deplore their own,\nwhile he pities common and foreign offenses.\n"

And he does not abstain from this form of instruction either, but says by Jeremiah, “How long shall I cry, and you not hear? So your ears are uncircumcised.” O blessed forbearance! And again, by the same: “All the heathen are uncircumcised, but this people is uncircumcised in heart,” “for the people are disobedient children,” he says, “in whom faith does not exist.” … Bewailing one’s fate is latent censure and artfully helps to bring salvation, albeit under stealth. He made use of this by Jeremiah: “How did the city sit solitary that was full of people! She that ruled over territories became as a widow; she came under tribute; weeping, she wept in the night.” … In the end, the system God pursues to inspire fear is the source of salvation. And it is the prerogative of goodness to save: “The mercy of the Lord is on all flesh, while he reproves, corrects and teaches as a shepherd does his flock. He pities those who receive his instruction and those who eagerly seek union with him.” … “For according to the greatness of his mercy, so is his rebuke.” For it is indeed noble not to sin, but it is good also for the sinner to repent, just as it is best to be always in good health but well to recover from disease. So he commands by Solomon, “Strike your son with the rod, that you may deliver his soul from death.” And again, “Do not abstain from chastising your son but correct him with the rod, for he will not die.” For reproof and rebuke, as also the original term implies, are the stripes of the soul, chastising sins, preventing death and leading to self-control for those who are out of control.… And so we, too, who in our lives are sick with shameful lusts and reprehensible excesses and other inflammatory effects of the passions, need the Savior. And he administers not only mild but also stringent medicines. The bitter roots of fear then arrest the eating sores of our sins. This is why fear is also salutary, if bitter. Sick, we truly stand in need of the Savior; having wandered, of one to guide us; blind, of one to lead us to the light; thirsty, “of the fountain of life, of which whoever partakes shall no longer thirst”; dead, we need life; sheep, we need a shepherd; we who are children need a tutor, while universal humanity stands in need of Jesus; so that we may not continue intractable and sinners to the end and thus fall into condemnation but may be separated from the chaff and stored up in the paternal garner.\n"

WEEPING SHE HAS WEPT IN THE NIGHT: what it is she bewails, the letter BETH makes clear through its interpretation, ‘house’, that house, namely, that entered into Egypt with Jacob and went out by the mercy of the Lord, according to this: When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob. But on the other hand, because of her sins, she is taken captive in Babylon, and therefore WEEPING she weeps IN THE NIGHT, because in the day, rest is not given to them, that they at least may be consoled by their own tears and, at a late hour, cleanse their eyes, which they previously used to raise to idols and, which is worse, THERE IS NONE TO COMFORT HER of all her friends previously flattering her.\n\nHER TEARS ARE ON HER CHEEKS, so that they may be more confused among the enemies and be content with their own disgrace. By means of idolatry, however, the people, brought into captivity, was harshly shattered by its enemies, but even harsher by Titus and Vespasian; the people, who for long have been upheld by God’s patience, but, being impenitent, have treasured up anger towards themselves in the day of wrath.\n\nAllegorical interpretation. WEEPING SHE HAS WEPT IN THE NIGHT: the Church of Christ weeps IN THE NIGHT, that is to say among the adversities of this life, since she, although predestined to glory, nevertheless abides in the obscurity of ignorance and the hazards of blindness. She weeps what she endures without; within she weeps the hardships of her infirmity; but she weeps WEEPING, because she is previously punctured on the inside and thus baptized on the outside with her own tears, which are produced from the spring of her heart, and of whose abundance the prophet makes allusion when he says: WEEPING SHE HAS WEPT. In this fashion the outward man needing to be reshaped is cleansed no less than the inward, whence it follows:\n\nHER TEARS ARE ON HER CHEEKS: those who know to mourn and not conceal their own faults nor those of others, of whom it is spoken in the Canticles: Thy cheeks are as a piece of a pomegranate, besides that which lies hid within. Indeed, in these the beauty of the Church is shown and through their proclamation we are drawn to the body of the Church. Just as those who labor more than others in the body of Christ, they mourn more and lament those whom they see abide in the night of wrongs and in the blindness of error. The Church weeps IN THE NIGHT and does not ignore the shadows of her sins. She carries her tears ON HER CHEEKS, with which she every day renews her beauty. To be sure, Mary is of benefit to Martha being troubled, when she weeps WEEPING at the Lord’s feet. The bride weeps far away from her spouse’s embrace, and she weeps in the valley, that is to say IN THE NIGHT of this ignorance. WEEPING SHE HAS WEPT, namely of desire for the heavenly fatherland and for her own sins and the sins of others in this world. She weeps for those who are dead to the world, she weeps for virgins, for widows, she weeps for all who confess themselves\npilgrims and visitors to this earth.\n\nTHERE IS NONE TO COMFORT HER AMONG ALL THEM THAT WERE DEAR TO HER: that is to say the saints or the angels, unless she receives the comfort of her spouse. Hence ALL HER FRIENDS HAVE DESPISED HER, since God scorns her, AND HAVE BECOME HER ENEMIES, to whom God is an enemy, with whose justice they cannot be at variance.\n\nMoral interpretation. WEEPING SHE HAS WEPT IN THE NIGHT: that is to say the soul, in the blindness of sin, of which it is said: Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise. But she does not weep on her own decision, but due to the Lord’s compassion, whence the prophet, wailing in the person of the Lord, says: How doth the city sit solitary &c. For lest the Lord, moved by pity, had seen her sit solitary, she had hardly lamented herself. The Lord looked on Peter, and he wept bitterly.\n\nHER TEARS ARE ON HER CHEEKS: the cheek is the conscience of the soul. The face is formed by the cheeks; the character of everyone is shown in the conscience. The conscience, however, that is aware of its sins, should always let itself be watered from the spring of tears, whence David: My sin is always before me. Alternatively THERE IS NONE TO COMFORT HER, the true Paraclete being dismissed, that is the Holy Ghost, especially as ALL HER FRIENDS, i. e. the desires for perverted pleasure, BECOME HER ENEMIES, when, according to the Apostle, on Judgement Day thoughts will rise, accusing or defending the poor conscience, and demons, most wicked persuaders, who now flatter by deceiving.\n"

        "txt": "Here in Verse 3 the misery throughout the captivity's periods is exposed, as to its magnitude. Such is twofold: first, the servitude itself is lamented regarding suppression of human kind, second as to its possessions. As expressed further on in Verse 7 (\"Zain\"): \"When her people fell into the hand of the foe, and there was none to help her, the foe gloated over her, mocking at her downfall.\"\n\nThe first part, (servitude itself) is divided twofold. First, misery from oppression is loudly bewailed. Secondly, the reason for this misery is shown. As Verse 8 \"Heth\", declares: \"Jerusalem sinned grievously, therefore she became filthy; all who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; yea, she herself groans, and turns her face away.\"\n\nAs to misery from oppression there are two more notions: First this misery is bewailed as to a present affliction sustained, second, as to an affliction recalled. As Verse 7 \"'Zain\" states: \"Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and bitterness all the precious things that were hers from days of old\" etc..\n\nRegarding present affliction there sustained, three further ideas are also presented. First, is the misery itself as to persons fleeing, second as to those remaining. As expressed in Verse 24' \"Daleth\": \"The roads to Zion mourn, for none come to the appointed feasts; all her gates are desolate, her priests groan; her maidens have been dragged away, and she herself suffers bitterly.\"\n\nThirdly are those captives, as pointed out in Verse 5: \"He\": \"Her foes have become the head, her enemies prosper, because, the Lord has made her suffer for the multitude of her transgressions; her children have gone away, captives before the foe.\"\n\nRegarding the misery of those fleeing three notes are made. First, as to the flight itself, as Verse 3 says: \"Judah has gone into exile because of affliction and hard servitude.\" That is, regarding persons fleeing from the land of Judah to the lands of their neighbors.\n\nAnd: \"because of affliction\" (on the people) and hard servitude\": through taxes, or tributes. For these persons did suffer on the lands of the Chaldaeans. The prophet Isaiah 16:3 states: \"Hide the outcasts, betray not the fugitive; let the outcast of Moab sojourn among you;\". Again: Isaiah 2l:l5 declares: \"To the thirsty bring water, meet the fugitive with bread, O in habitants of the land of Tema. For, they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the press of battle.\"\n\nSecondly, the imminent straits of those fleeing is bewailed. As Verse 3 says: \"she dwells among the nations\". That is, among the Moabites and the Ismahelites. Then, \"but finds no resting place\". For, even there an obstacle was suffered by them. Also, in Deuteronomy 28:65 is asserted: \"And among these nations you shall find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of sour foot.\n\nThirdly, is predicted obstacles in overcoming the power of enemies. As stated in Verse 3: \"her pursuers (the Chaldaeans)have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress\".\n\nThis distress was experienced even towards whom the people fled to, just like in Egypt. As Jeremiah 12:l6 declares: \"Then the sword which you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow hard after you to Egypt; and there you shall die.\"\n\nTo this Verse 3 the Hebrew letter \"Ghimel\" is set forth, which is interpreted as \"a plentitude\". Because, for a plentitude of their sins the people suffer a plentitude of miseries. As Matthew 23:32 expresses this: \"Fill up then the measure of your father\". And Luke declares: \"For the measure you give will be the measure you get back\" (Lk 6:38).\n\nAllegorically, the word \"Judah\" in Verse 3 refers to the Church, as joined to Christ. The words also in Verse 3: \" has gone into exile\n\nbecause of affliction\", connote hostages. And there are hostages among hostages among whom one seeks peace. Then: \"but finds no resting place\": like one oppressed at will by everyone. Moreover, the word \"Judah\" in Verse 3 may mean a soul that ought to believe in God.\n\nThen, Verse 3 continues: \"has gone into exile,\" Namely , into corruptions and demons. And: \"but finds no resting place\": by fleeing such corruptions and demons.\n\nThen is said: \"her pursuers\". That is, such demons \"have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress\": in death.\n"

        "txt": "JUDAH HAS REMOVED: the tenth topic of complaint, by which helplessness, weakness and loneliness are revealed.\n\nHistorical interpretation. JUDAH HAS MIGRATED &c: that is to say, due to their manifold sins they have been led into captivity not only to Babylon but thence, on account of the sufferings of serfdom, as runaway slaves they have migrated to other peoples, but not even there have they found rest. From which follows: ALL HER PERSECUTORS HAVE TAKEN HER &c, namely those who pursued the fugitives and previously more cruelly had shattered the distressed. In fact, those who had fled the light yoke of the Lord, are justly being overwhelmed by heavy sufferings, and those who despised the liberty promised in Christ, deservedly labored in the sufferings of serfdom. JUDAH HAS MIGRATED from one kind of enemy to another, fleeing the unmercifulness of her lords. As Cain the fratricide wandering about and banished, so the Jews dwell amongst the gentiles finding no rest, carrying about the disgrace of their confusion, because they did not fear to kill Christ, their brother.\n\nAllegorical interpretation. JUDAH HAS MIGRATED &c: liberty lost, the Church of Christ often migrates into the serfdom of the gentiles and the suffering of vices, and finds no rest, but fleeing from place to place and seized by her persecutors, she suffers worse anguish. Often, however, our Jerusalem is in this way historically captured and suffers and roams captive among enemies, just as the earthly Jerusalem fore-showed historically.\n\nMoral interpretation. JUDAH HAS MIGRATED &c: namely the soul, who ought to praise God and, accusing herself, unfold her sins, afflicted by the slavery of her sins, she wanders from vices to vice, and SHE HAS FOUND NO REST. Hence the apostle: I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind and captivating me in the law of sin that is in my members. There is no way to escape, unless the one he himself shows through the grace of God, by Jesus Christ. But the miserable soul, exhausted at last in the manner of pregnant women, is caught by her persecutors IN THE MIDST OF STRAITS, whence: Woe to them that are with child and that give suck in those days.\n"

        "txt": "Here in Verse 4 is loudly lamented the misery of persons remaining. First, regarding such persons who frequent pilgrimages. As expressed: \"The roads to Zion mourn, for none come to the appointed feasts\". That is, while they arouse contentions during three feasts: (Psach, Pentecost, and Scenopegia). To such the prophet Isaiah 33:8 refers: \"The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases. Covenants are broken, witnessess are despised, there is no regard for man\".\n\nSecond, as to those persons remaining, like the leaders, or priests, the city honors. As said: \"all her gates are desolate\". And the propher Isaiah states: \"And her gates shall lament and mourn; ravaged, she shall sit upon the ground.\" (Is 3:26)\n\nThen: \"her priests groan\". As the minor propher Joel discloses: \"Between the vestibule and the altar let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep\" (Jo 2:17).\n\nAlso, regarding maidens and virgins, Verse 4 says: \"Their maidens have been dragged away\". Namely, they are violated. As Job remarks: \"Through want and hard hunger they gnaw the dry and desolate ground; they pick mallow and the leaves of bushes, and to warm themselves the roots of the broom\" (Job: 30:3). And: I Maccabees l:11: \"He gathered a very strong army and ruled over countries, nations, and princes, and they became tributary to him\".\n\nThird, is stated the people who comprise the city: \"And she herself (Jerusalem) suffers bitterly\". As the Book of Ruth 1:20 declares: Do not call me Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt bitterly with me\".\n\nTo Verse 4 is applied the Hebrew letter \"Daleth\", meaning \"troubled\". For, the destruction of the Temple (at Jerusalem) is loudly lamented. That is, due to its cedared and gold tablets. As recorded in I Kings, Chapter 6 (Building the House of the Lord\") where is listed the eighth period of the people's captivity.\n\nAllegorically, the word \"roads\" in Verse 4 connotes those ways leading to heaven. And: \"to Zion\". the place of prophets, and preachers.\n\nThen: \"to the appointed feasts\". That is, as if within the celestial fatherland, heaven. And: \"all her gates are desolate. Namely, the prelates of the Church.\n\nAlso: \"her priests groan\":those who administer sacred functions. And: \"her maidens have been dragged away, and she herself suffers bitterly\". Namely, those who obtain pre-eminent status within the Church.\n\nAll such persons are agitated through sin, as they unite their people together, subdued and filled with bitterness. Hence, the Book of Exodus claims: \"And as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses' anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.\" (Ex: 32:19).\n\nMorally, the word \"roads\" connotes the virtues or powers, of the human soul. And: \"the appointed feasts\": for contemplation. Also: \"all her gates are desolate\": morally, the (internal and external) senses.\n\nVerse 4 then concludes: \"her priests groan\", Namely, those human souls with the sanctity of a divine religion. And: \"her maidens have been dragged away, and she herself suffers bitterly\". That is, morally, when purity of conscience is broken, leaving human soul troubled, filled with bitterness.\n"

The present elaborate, far-fetched and artificial treatment of theology had not made its way into the schools of divinity, but playing with pebbles that deceive the eye by the quickness of their changes or dancing before an audience with varied and effeminate contortions were looked on as all one with speaking or hearing of God in a way unusual or frivolous. But since the Sextuses and Pyrrhos, and the antithetic style, like a dire and malignant disease, have infected our churches, and babbling is reputed culture, and, as the book of the Acts says of the Athenians, we spend our time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing. O, what Jeremiah will bewail our confusion and blind madness; he alone could utter lamentations befitting our misfortunes.The beginning of this madness was Arius (whose name is derived from frenzy). He paid the penalty of his unbridled tongue by his death in a profane spot, brought about by prayer not by disease, when he like Judas burst asunder for his similar treachery to the Word. Then others, catching the infection, organized an art of impiety and, confining Deity to the Unbegotten, expelled from Deity not only the Begotten but also the proceeding one, and honored the Trinity with communion in name alone or even refused to retain this for it. Not so that blessed one who was indeed a man of God and a mighty trumpet of truth: but being aware that to contract the three persons to a numerical unity is heretical and the innovation of Sabellius, who first devised a contraction of Deity; and that to sever the three persons by a distinction of nature is an unnatural mutilation of Deity; he both happily preserved the unity, which belongs to the Godhead, and religiously taught the Trinity, which refers to personality, neither confounding the three persons in the unity nor dividing the substance among the three persons but abiding within the bounds of piety by avoiding excessive inclination or opposition to either side.\n"

        "txt": "“Call for the mourning women,” the prophet Jeremiah says. In no other way can the burning heart cool down, swelling as it is with its affliction, unless it relieves itself by sobs and tears.… You have heard certain mournful and lamenting words of Jeremiah that he used to mourn Jerusalem as a deserted city and how among other expressions of passionate grief he added this, “The ways of Zion do mourn.” These words were uttered then, but now they have been realized. For when the news of our calamity shall have been spread abroad, then will the ways be full of mourning crowds and the sheep of his flock will pour themselves forth and like the Ninevites utter the voice of lamentation, or, rather, will lament more bitterly than they. For in their case their mourning released them from the cause of their fear, but with these no hope of release from their distress removes their need of mourning. I know, too, of another utterance of Jeremiah, which is reckoned among the books of the Psalms. It is that which he made over the captivity of Israel. The words run thus: “We hung our harps on the willows and condemned ourselves as well as our harps to silence.” I make this song my own. For when I see the confusion of heresy, this confusion is Babylon. And when I see the flood of trials that pours in on us from this confusion, I say that these are “the waters of Babylon by which we sit down and weep” because there is no one to guide us over them. Even if you mention the willows, and the harps that hung there, that part also of the figure shall be mine. For, in truth, our life is among willows, the willow being a fruitless tree, and the sweet fruit of our life having all withered away. Therefore we have become fruitless willows, and the harps of love we hung on those trees are idle and the strings no longer vibrate. “If I forget you, O Jerusalem,” he adds, “may my right hand be forgotten.” Suffer me to make a slight alteration in that text. It is not we who have forgotten the right hand but the right hand that has forgotten us; and the “tongue has cleaved to the roof of” his own “mouth” and barred the passage of his words, so that we can never again hear that sweet voice. But let me have all tears wiped away, for I feel that I am indulging more than is right in this sorrow for our loss.Our Bridegroom has not been taken from us. He stands in our midst, although we see him not. The Priest is within the holy place. He has entered into that within the veil, where our forerunner Christ has entered for us. He has left behind him the curtain of the flesh. No longer does he pray to the type or shadow of the things in heaven, but he looks on the very embodiment of these realities. No longer through a glass darkly does he intercede with God, but face to face he intercedes with him; and he intercedes for us and for the “negligences and ignorances” of the people. He has put away the coats of skin, no need is there now for the dwellers in paradise to wear such garments as these; but he wears the clothing that the purity of his life has woven into a glorious dress. “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death” of such an individual, or rather it is not death but the breaking of bonds, as it is said, “You have broken my bonds asunder.” Simeon has been allowed to leave. He has been freed from the bondage of the body. The “snare is broken, and the bird has flown away.” He has left Egypt behind, this material life. He has crossed not this Red Sea of ours but the black, gloomy sea of life. He has entered on the land of promise and holds lofty conversations with God on the mountain. He has loosed the sandal of his soul, that with the pure step of thought he may set foot on that holy land where there is the vision of God. Having therefore this consolation, you who are conveying the bones of our Joseph to the place of blessing should listen to the exhortation of Paul: “Do not mourn as others who have no hope.”\n"

Through the service of which the house of the Lord rises, joined together in a fourfold cupola, namely by the ways, gates, priests and virgins.\n\nTHE WAYS OF ZION &c: the eighth topic of complaint, in which something is said to have happened which ought not, or that something did not happen, which ought to have happened.\n\nHistorical interpretation. THE WAYS OF ZION MOURN &c: from the general term set before he moves to the species of the single persons, for the grief to multiply more amply, as the general term is divided into species and the species are collected anew in the general term, and, since Threni are composed according to the rules of metre, they are occasionally adorned with figures of secular eloquence and by means of rhetorical devices distinguished by metaphors. Hence it is said here: THE WAYS OF ZION MOURN &c, not that the ways should feel or mourn, but brought into solitude, they excite grief in those who pass by, BECAUSE THERE ARE NONE THAT COME TO THE SOLEMN FEAST. In a similar way Moses says: Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak &c. Also Isaiah summons heaven and earth as witnesses, for every element to know that God is justly enraged and\nprovoked to wrath.\n\nAllegorical interpretation. THE WAYS OF ZION MOURN &c: as often as the Church, due to her sins, is filled within and without with the bitterness of God’s wrath, the WAYS deservedly MOURN, the GATES lie BROKEN DOWN, the PRIESTS SIGH, the VIRGINS are FOUL, so that the whole flooring of the house, arranged according to a fourfold number, looks violently agitated. Hence Jeremiah elsewhere: Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the ways of the Lord. THE WAYS are the prophets, patriarchs and others, through whom one reaches Christ, who is the true way. For as they are named ‘light’ from the light, Christ, so can the ways be named from him, whence Abraham is called the first way of believing. They (the patriarchs and prophets) are THE WAYS OF ZION, that is of the heavenly city; they (the ways) MOURN and groan, BECAUSE THERE ARE NONE THAT COME TO the feasts of the heavenly fatherland, because THE GATES ARE BROKEN DOWN. For those who preside over the office neither enter themselves, nor permit others to enter. HER PRIESTS SIGH, because THE WAYS MOURN; HER VIRGINS ARE FOUL, because the GATES ARE WRECKED. The priests, however, are rightly united to the virgins, since the priesthood is strong through virginity, and virginity is in need of guidance from the priesthood, with which states ravished, the throng of followers comes to a halt. From which generally follows: AND SHE IS OPPRESSED WITH BITTERNESS, as, if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it.\n\nMoral interpretation. THE WAYS OF ZION MOURN &c: that is to say, the virtues, namely those leading to the Jerusalem above, to the SOLEMN FEAST of the soul, from whom the spouse is removed, when the soul slips from the summit of supernal intention to outward actions. Her solemnity is the intimate contemplation of heavenly life, but THERE ARE NONE THAT COME TO THE SOLEMN FEAST; the desires, namely, of prior life do not reach to the solemnities of divine contemplation, since the GATES of the senses ARE WRECKED. Indeed, there are gates of death, and of justice, of which it is said: Open ye to me the gates of justice &c; and in Isaiah: Open ye the gates, and let the just nation enter in. But, as death has entered through our windows, the soul’s virginity is filthy and the kingly priesthood groans, while we, instead of with virtues, are filled with the bitterness of sin. Let us therefore march out from the gates of death and rebuild the gates of life, inquiring which gate is the Lord’s, for us to walk through.\n"

As further on is said in Verse 6 (\"Vau\"): \"From the daughter of Zion has departed all her majesty.\"\n\nRegarding minor captives three ideas are advanced. First, is the exaltation of enemies' power like: \"Her foes\", Namely, the Chaldaeans. And: \"have become the head\". That is, as if lording over them.\n\nThen, to possessions it refers: \"her enemies prosper\". As Deuteronomy 28:13 declares: \"And the Lord will make you the head, and not the tail; and you shall tend upward only, and not downward.\n\nSecondly is assigned from these possessions an exaltation of the enemies' power. As expressed: \"because the Lord has made her suffer for the multitude of her transgressions\", Namely, as if si~ch sentences against herself (Jerusalem) inspire tribes to come forward as Moses foretold. Again: \"for the multitude of her transgressions\", So, Jeremiah declares: \"And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it.\" (Jer: 18:9).\n\nThird, is a setting forth of this captivity: \"her children have gone away, captives before the foe\". Namely, as children of the chosen people. Hence Isaiah 5:13 states: \"Therefore my people go into exile for want of knowledge.\"\n\nTo this Verse 5 is applied the Hebrew letter \"He\". That is, \"judgments\", that God spoke to Moses, in the eighth period of the people's captivity.\n\nHence Verse 5 concludes: \"for the multitude of her transgressions; her children have gone away, captives before the foe.\" And such is a first period of an assumed general situation, termed as a \"concession\".\n\nAllegorically the phrase, \"her foes\" in Verse 5 denotes \"heretics\", lacking due knowledge of the Church. So: \"have become the head\": prevailing over contentions. And: \"her enemies prosper\": allegorically, by their eloquence. Also, allegorically \"because the Lord has made her suffer\" permissively. And \"her children have gone away\": going forth while, \"captives before the foe\": abducted from the Church.\n\nMorally, the phrase, \"her foes\" connote demons. And: \"have become the head\": corrupting all the people's intentions. So, \"her enemies prosper\": from their many sins.\n\nAgain: \"because the Lord has made her suffer for the multitude of her transgressions\". (Verse 5). That is, the Lord permitting this. And: \"her children have gone away\": both moved and effected. \"captives before the foe\". Thus, Psalm l3(12):5: \"lest my enemy say, 'I have prevailed over him'; lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken\".\n"

        "txt": "HER ADVERSARIES HAVE BECOME: the eighth topic of complaint.\n\nHistorical interpretation. HER ADVERSARIES HAVE BECOME HER LORDS; HER ENEMIES ARE ENRICHED, because the Lord has spoken through Moses, namely, saying in Deuteronomy: The Lord make thee to fall down before thy enemies, and be scattered throughout all the kingdoms of the earth. May thy sons and daughters be given to another people ; and somewhat later: The stranger that lives with thee in the land, shall rise up over thee, and shall be higher. He shall be as the head, and thou shalt be the tail. This, however, the Lord has said due to the iniquity of Jerusalem, not to incite her to sin by commanding, but by warning to recall her from sin. But, as she was unwilling to obey, the prophet laments that all this has happened, though by God’s just judgement. Accordingly, the letter HE, which is interpreted ‘those’, is put before, as if he were saying: ‘those are the judgements, that the Lord once had fore-said through Moses.’\n\nAllegorical interpretation. HER ADVERSARIES HAVE BECOME: that is to say, heretics or pagans or bad Catholics; THEY ARE ENRICHED with the eloquence of preaching, as there is want of intelligence. From which it is said: I will send forth a famine into the land: not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord, because, when this is removed, the enemies of the Church are elevated to LORDS and are enriched with the treasures of Scripture FOR THE MULTITUDE OF our INIQUITIES. But then like dumb dogs not able to bark, they cannot defend the faith, nor provide the due teaching to their subjects. Hence HER CHILDREN, who have not the perfection of the teaching, are led INTO CAPTIVITY, not having masters or defenders, BEFORE THE FACE OF THE OPPRESSOR, that is to say the enemy, visible or invisible, and tied by the chains of blemish.\n\nMoral interpretation. THEY HAVE BECOME &c: the ruling demons, to wit, of whom it is said: If the spirit of him that hath power ascend upon thee, leave not thy place. In fact, if the poor soul watchfully had taken heed, she had not allowed HER ADVERSARIES, wickedly urging, to become HER LORDS.\n\nTHEY ARE ENRICHED: against us, namely, they prevail with their habit of vices growing, so that we cannot escape, unless with God’s help. But he too is furious who on account of this our iniquity has spoken to punish, he who speaks once, and repeats not the selfsame thing the second time. One must not despair, however, nor cease from mourning, as but HER CHILDREN, that is to say the faint of heart and not the strong, are captured BEFORE THE FACE OF THE OPPRESSOR, ensnared in many fetters, that is, from which they are nevertheless set free by God showing pity. For her adversaries, made more potent, threaten, sometimes AS LORDS defiling the good intention itself, sometimes by a longer use of pleasure entangling the resisting soul, according to this saying of Solomon: He that nourishes his servant delicately from his childhood, afterwards shall find him stubborn. We are set free from them with greater difficulty, the more superior and the more enriched they dominate as lords.\n"

As stated: \"From the daughter of Zion has departed all her majesty.\" For instance, like vases taken away, and treasures from both leaders and priests around Jehoiachin, nephew of Josiah. (cf: II Kings Chapter 24 (\"Nebuchadnezzar Conquers Judah\"). So, the prophet Ezekiel declares: \"They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your fine jewels.\" (Ez 23:26).\n\nSecondly, is the necessity for supplies. As said: \"Her princes have become like harts that find no pasture\". That is, neither for themselves, or for their people. For, even bread is lacking within the city, when besieged at the time of Zedekiah. (cf. Jeremiah, Chapter 31 (\"The Lord is Our Righteousness\"). And the prophet Isaiah records: \"And the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude go down, her throng and he who exults her.\" (Is 5:l4).\n\nThirdly, the captivity of leaders is considered. As stated: \"They fled without strength before the pursuers.\" Namely, they are powerless to resist, as recorded by Jeremiah, Chapter 52. (\"The leaders fled into the camp of Jehoiachin, king of Judah\". And as said in Psalm 38(37):lO: \"My heart throbs, my strength fails me.\"\n\nNow to this Verse 6 is applied the Hebrew letter \"Vau\", and interpreted as: \"And\". That is, as if also these ideas are related to leaders, within a vindication by the Lord God, and within the fifth period of the captivity.\n\nAllegorically, \"the daughter of Zion\" can refer to the Church, as a celestial Zion. This is exemplified whensoever the phrase is set forth as an ornament of the faith.\n\nAnd: \"Her princes\" can refer to prelates who fall into error before a pursuer. For instance, as the devil, or demon, likened to a heretic perverting the faith.\n\nAlso: \"that find no pasture,\" as within the Sacred Scriptures. And: \"become like harts\": in reference to words of God, Our Lord Jesus Christ.\n"

AND FROM THE DAUGHTER OF ZION IS DEPARTED: before this sentence is put VAU, that is interpreted ‘and’, as if those set before above are connected as a punishment by God’s just judgement. Indeed, Jerusalem besieged had lost all the ornament of her beauty without, and within that of delight; her riches taken away and the temple and the priesthood desecrated, she herself labors in hunger and pestilence. And there were none who would come to her aid, because HER PRINCES HAVE BECOME LIKE RAMS THAT FIND NO PASTURES, with virtues dissolved and trembling hearts they are not considering defending themselves but fleeing.\n\nAllegorical interpretation. AND FROM THE DAUGHTER OF ZION IS DEPARTED: namely the Church, of which it is said in the Canticles: Behold thou are fair, O my love. Beauty departs from her, when her faith is corrupted by the rage of heretics, of which is said: Thou hast put on praise and beauty.\n\nHER PRINCES HAVE BECOME: that is to say the shepherds and herdsmen not finding the pastures of life in the Scriptures HAVE GONE AWAY WITHOUT STRENGTH of the divine word, whither-soever error urges them, BEFORE THE FACE OF THE PURSUER, so that they themselves, who neglect to drive the Lord’s flock to the pastures of life, rush bound to the pastures of death, without the strength of the virtues. Indeed, the beauty of the Church lies in all her faithful, but most of all in her priests and those assisting at the altar, and in her virgins, who are mentioned above as being foul.\n\nMoral interpretation. AND FROM THE DAUGHTER OF ZION IS DEPARTED: the soul, that is to say, allured by malicious customs, who has lost her beauty, that is the ornament of virtues. And her princes, namely the rational operations of the soul or the defenses of Scripture, have not come to her aid, with which she ought to thrust back her pursuers, but, with the strength of virtue more wearied and tied by the clasps of her transgression, she is hurled into the pit of eternal confusion.\n"

AND JERUSALEM HAS REMEMBERED &c: she remembers HER DESIRABLE THINGS, not for consolation, but to multiply the pain, when HER PEOPLE fall INTO THE ENEMY’S HAND. Hence ZAIN, that is interpreted ‘this’, is put before. For this is the perfect revenge, that she is in pains about her lost goods and about the consciousness of her prevarication and about the evil things she has suffered incessantly, as if ‘this is the divine and perfect revenge’ that the legislator had declared, namely, when she FELL INTO THE enemies’ HAND none would come to her assistance. Moreover, THE ENEMIES HAVE SEEN HER &c: just as we today deride the circumcised sabbath of the Jews, because they slayed him in whom they should have had the true sabbath. This is nevertheless a just balancing of transgressions, to fall into the enemies’ hands, continually to remember the days not only of affliction but of prevarication, and, out of remembrance, to gaze eagerly at the use of the desirable things, for a new pain to rise from the affliction, and from the prevarication a sorrow of confusion, from the lost goods to kindle a desire beyond cure, from the duties of her religion to set aflame scandal.  \n\nAllegorical interpretation. AND JERUSALEM HAS REMEMBERED &c: in fact, the Church often beholds her people falling into the hands of the enemies, that is to say the demons; one falls through avarice, the other through luxury, yet another through delight of the flesh. For all those and alike, the Church continuously laments. She remembers ALL HER DESIRABLE THINGS which have been promised us in heaven, from which place also we fall away, and she herself sojourns abroad. Also our Sabbaths, that is feasts, are dishonored no less by us than they are derided by our enemies, whence: Where is their God? And elsewhere: My tears have been my bread day and night, whilst it is said to me daily: where is thy God?\n\nTHE ENEMIES HAVE SEEN HER &c: delivered either into the hands of pagans or heretics or to vices, we often, for the sake of our sins, remember our prevarication, and then the demons mock at our Sabbaths, when they see us being disengaged from good. Hence: They that trouble me, will rejoice when I am moved.  \n\nMoral interpretation. AND JERUSALEM HAS REMEMBERED: the soul remembers, although too late, HER DESIRABLE THINGS, when she observes that she is curtailed everywhere and that her compassion fall into the hands of the devil and that which is struck by divine vengeance, which she thought stood more firm. Then the deeds of prevarication occur, then remembrance of affliction most wicked, on account of which she had roamed through many crimes, not for consolation, but for increasing of the punishment according to that which the wicked will say in hell: We have erred from the way of truth, and the light of justice hath not shined unto us, and the sun hath not risen upon us. We wearied ourselves in the way of iniquity and destruction, and have walked through hard ways. What hath pride profited us? or what advantage hath the boasting of riches brought us? All those things are passed away like a shadow of death; we are consumed in our wickedness.\n\nTHE ENEMIES HAVE SEEN HER &c: the malicious spirits lead astray and thus deceive the leisure of our freedom into illicit thoughts, which canons and monks and everyone who is devoted to the ministry of God, must very much beware of, lest their own Sabbaths not only be disapproved of by the judge within, but also laughed at by the enemies. If, however, our Sabbaths are mocked for the sake of our vain thoughts, what is one to think of those people, who, when they ought to be devoted to God, do not fear even to commit disgraceful things? If we therefore wish to be devoted to God, let us with heart and deed be devoted to Him alone, whence: O taste and see because I am the Lord.\n"

They themselves SIGHING are TURNED BACKWARD. \n\nMoral interpretation.

Hence the angels or holy men, who previously honored her, disdain her, that she finally may bewail her sin and return to God, hearing a voice calling from behind, whence Isaiah: Thy ears shall hear the word of one admonishing thee behind thy back. Thereupon Mary, TURNED BACKWARD, found Jesus, whom she was looking for, but could not find. Likewise Jerusalem, that is here lamented for the sake of the sin of infidelity, if she, TURNED BACKWARD and SIGHING, knows and believes, will find in the law the one she thought was dead. But those who are incredulous and do not look backward, even until this day, are, like Cain, unstable and carry the sign of their confusion and march to Babylon, that is to confusion.\n"

HER FILTHINESS &c: as if: Jerusalem has become unstable and, exhausted after a long journey, carries HER FILTHINESS ON HER FEET, because she laments more over interior man than over exterior. The feet of the synagogue are the teachers of the law, who ought to lead her along the way, who is Christ, but these feet have been soiled by the filth of crime. AND SHE HAS NOT REMEMBERED HER END, that is Christ, who is the end of the law, unto justice to every one that believes.\n\nTherefore SHE IS VIOLENTLY CAST DOWN. Hence Jerusalem cries out with her own voice: BEHOLD, O LORD &c. For indeed, from the beginning hitherto the prophet has lamented, but henceforth she herself bewails her own distress, humbled and having confessed her sin, which is meant by the letter TETH, that is interpreted ‘good’, whence: It is good for me, O Lord, that thou hast humbled me. She herself being humiliated, however, no longer bears with the prophet, but cries out with sighs and tears: BEHOLD, O LORD &c. In a rhetorical manner, she performs the lamentation with indignation, to move the judge towards her enemies and receive pity herself. Hence she adds: BECAUSE THE ENEMY IS LIFTED UP, namely against you, and he does not reckon your justice, but his own arrogance. As if: ‘BEHOLD first MY AFFLICTION, that you may show pity, not my misdeeds, because of which you become angry, and second, because THE ENEMY IS LIFTED UP, that you may punish.’  \n\nAllegorical interpretation. HER FILTHINESS: the Church carries HER FILTHINESS ON HER FEET, because in the misery of this life there is none who would march along without some foulness of vice at least on his feet, with which the earth is touched. From that, the Lord washes the feet of the disciples and bids us mutually to do the same, and he says to the apostles: Shake off the dust from your feet. Nevertheless he washed their feet for them to become excellent and clean and thus to run about the whole world to preach. Of these feet it is said: How beautiful are thy steps in shoes, O prince’s daughter! And elsewhere: Feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. HER FILTHINESS, however, IS ON HER FEET, the false life in the preachers, who do not remember their end, the future judgement. Hence they are VIOLENTLY CAST DOWN before the eyes of God, not having the Paraclete, they who ought to console others. Accordingly, turned back and humiliated, they call: BEHOLD, O LORD. \n\nMoral interpretation. HER FILTHINESS IS ON HER FEET: the soul has its FILTHINESS ON HER FEET, namely the filthiness of her vices, she who has lost the splendor of heavenly life and of her former way of life. Hence: Shake thyself from the dust, arise, sit up, O Jerusalem. Indeed, it is necessary that the soul, who seeks earthly acts, has FILTHINESS ON HER FEET, that is on her desires. Hence: For our soul is humbled down to the dust. From this the feet ought to be washed daily, for that not to happen, which follows: She has forgotten HER END, SHE IS VIOLENTLY CAST DOWN, NOT HAVING A COMFORTER. But let the soul say, let the Church say: BEHOLD, O LORD, MY AFFLICTION, not my sin, that you may condemn me, but my AFFLICTION, to set me free, BECAUSE THE ENEMY IS LIFTED UP, reckoning himself, abusing you, as if you are unable to set free. Hence David: Many say to my soul: there is no salvation for him in his God.\n"

Second, is calculated the possessions destroyed. As declared: \"all her people groan as they search for bread\". (Verse 11).\n\nAbout the above idea two notions are proposed. First is the regard for plundered possessions. As said: \"The enemy has stretched out his hands over all her precious things\". Namely, the Chaldeans, the victors, stretched out their hands. That is, for the treasures of the house of God, of the royal house, and of all other houses. As the prophet Isaiah reminds: \"and all our pleasant places have become ruins\". (Is 64:ll).\n\nSecondly is considered the very profanation of the people. As stated: \"yea, she has seen the nations invade her sanctuary\". Namely, in such an order, so that it can happen that all possessions are taken away, even things within the sanctuary, or temple. As I Maccabees 2:8-9: \"Her temple has become like a man without honor; her glorious vessels have been carried into captivity.\"\n\nOr, otherwise: \"yea, she has seen the nations invade her sanctuary.\" That is, by the Lord God. Also: \"the nations invade her sanctuary\". Namely, sanctuary priests invade by word, though living nicely, as they possess an idol within their sanctuary.Again: \"those whom thou didst forbid to enter thy congregation\". The Book of Leviticus records that mankind, even from Aaron's root in whom is a stain, may\n\nnot utilize holy things from the Lord God (cf. Leviticus Chapter 22, \"Priests Shall be Holy to God\"). So since sanctuary priests utilized holy things, they also were led into captivity and servitude. As a result, their fault, or sin, is cause for punishment.\n"

THE ENEMY HAS PUT OUT HIS HAND: that is to say the Chaldean has put out his hand to the holy of holies, which it was not allowed but for priests to enter, and that once a year and with blood. He took away the vessels of beauty and violated the sanctuary, the reason for which is rendered, FOR the Lord HAS SEEN THE GENTILES ENTER INTO HIS SANCTUARY, that is the Jews, living as heathens and defiling the sanctuary, which he had himself forbidden. Hence it follows: OF WHOM YOU GAVE COMMANDMENT &c, whence also elsewhere: And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty into the hands of the enemy. And he shut up his people under the sword &c. \n\nAllegorical interpretation. THE ENEMY HAS PUT OUT HIS HAND &c: the old enemy puts out his hand to the Church’s desirable things, corrupting the faith in its limbs, abolishing baptism, falsifying doctrine, handling the body and blood of our Lord unworthily and devastating the precious vessels, that is Christ’s sheep, just as a wolf. And the reason for such an evil is rendered: FOR THE GENTILES, that is those finding pleasure in the flesh, almost still retaining their foreskin and not being in possession of the circumcision of Christ, are made ministers of the altar. \n\nMoral interpretation. THE ENEMY HAS PUT OUT HIS HAND &c: the devil rashly puts out his hand to the desirable things of the soul and takes away the ornaments of virtue: faith, hope, charity, prudence &c. The just judge allows this to happen, since he sees the GENTILES, namely vicious intimations, thoughts and passions, ENTER INTO the SANCTUARY of the soul, who ought to close her door and pray to the Father in her bedchamber. Then chastity is violated, abstinence subverted and the prince of cooks tries to overthrow all the walls, that is virtues, of the soul. Thus harvested of all its goods, he leaves the soul without a comforter.\n"

ALL HER PEOPLE SIGH &c: how great the hunger and pestilence the Jews suffered, the histories do not pass over in silence, and Josephus manifests it in particular. Hence: ALL HER PEOPLE SIGH AND SEEK BREAD &c; TO RELIEVE THE SOUL, that is corporeal life. SEE O LORD &c: note how the prophet was useful, when he lamented Jerusalem not lamenting herself, who nevertheless was introduced above, bewailing as it were in her more noble limbs, but now the whole people, as if having received some life-bringing spirit, is said to be lamenting. SEE, O LORD &c: just as the hen cherishes and kindles her eggs, so spiritual men gradually cherish their subjects, either by instructing or lamenting, to breathe life into them. \n\nAllegorical interpretation. ALL HER PEOPLE SIGH AND SEEK the BREAD of God’s word; the bread which comes down from heaven. In the distress of hunger the Church seeks this bread from the teachers, and does not find it, because THEY HAVE GIVEN ALL THEIR PRECIOUS THINGS FOR FOOD, that is to say divine things for earthly, eternal for perishable, TO RELIEVE THE SOUL, not to satisfy it, since they, ab last with innumerable desires, can relieve it, but not satisfy it. Also from this the people is referred to as sighing and seeking bread, since the vicious are afflicted and tortured, because they do not at will have the abundance of voluptuous life. \n\nMoral interpretation. ALL HER PEOPLE SIGH AND SEEK BREAD: any soul gives its precious things for food when it inclines the virtues of the mind toward transitory pleasure, and strives to be relieved, when it schemes to satisfy different desires. Hence the people laments, sighing and seeking bread, as although it has given its precious things for food, the desire for concupiscence is not satisfied by sight, taste and the other senses. Hence, if any virtue perchance returns and the soul reshaped by the Spirit of God regains health, it would, together with the multitude of the elect, wailing, exclaim: SEE O LORD &c. As if it would say: ‘I have become vile to myself, humiliated before my own eyes, because the hand of the Lord has touched me.’ For CAPH is interpreted ‘hand’; when the hand of the Lord either by instruction, or by punishment, or by alleviating the punishment has touched the soul or the neglectful Church, soon returning to itself and sighing, it says: SEE O LORD &c. As if it would say: ‘consider your creation, how vile it is become.’ The soul, who previously was amused by vices and bragged, as soon as she is touched by the hand of the Lord, declares herself vile, who is shaped to the likeness of her Creator.\n"

First in interpreted these people enduring a severity of judgment, second, the judgment of the enemy's cruelty. As said in Verse 11: \"Look, O Lord, and behold, for I am despised.\"\n\nRegarding a severity of judgment, two further ideas are advanced. First is set forth the severity of judgment in general, second in particular. As beyond said in Verse 15: \"The Lord flouted all my mighty men in the midst of me, he summoned an assembly against me to crush my young men.\n\nRegarding the general severity of judgment three more notions are conveyed. First is exposed the very indignation of the Lord God, as to how He vindicates through judgment.\n\nSecond is the severity of divine discipline regarding the Lord God educating through punishment. Like the next Verse 13 (\"Mem\") points out. \"From on high he sent fire; into my bones he made it descend; he spread a net at my feet; he turned me back; he has left me stunned, faint all the day long.\"\n\nThird is proposed the rigor of divine justice, insofar as the office of judge is exercised in punishing. As Verse l~4' states: \"My transgressions were bound into a yoke; by his hand they were fastened together.\n\nTo the first idea (indignation of the Lord God) three further notions are advanced. First, an invocation is considered. As said in Verse 12: \"Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look and see if there is any sorrow like to my sorrow which was brought upon me.\" That is, along this region of the desert. So Jeremiah says: \"And many nations will pass by this city, and every man will say to his neighbor, 'Why has the Lord dealt thus with this great city?'\" (Jer: 22:8)\n\nSecond the magnitude of their grief is viewed. Verse 12 says: \"Look and see\". For, while one considers their grief one does not view anything similar. Also, it was greatest, since everything was taken away. As Jeremiah 8:21 says: \"For the wound of the daughter of my people is my heart wounded, I mourn, and dismay has taken hold of me.\"\n\nThird, such indignation of the Lord God is viewed as to a reason for such grief. For, one will vindicate captivity, as you (the enemy) destroy inhabitants like a sta]k of grape clusters in a vineyard.\n\nFor the prophet Isaiah 5:7 states: \"For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting.\" And Psalm 80(79):12 says: \"Why then hast thou broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?\"\n\nThen, Verse 12 concludes: \"which the Lord inflicted on the day of his fierce anger\". That is, which the Lord threatens through his prophets.\n"

O ALL YOU THAT PASS BY  : it is characteristic of the unfortunate to estimate by so much more their own suffering, as they so much less care to comprehend a foreign one, and the more they perceive their own pain, they do not agree to comparing a foreign one with their own. But more truly a remnant that is saved laments such things with contrition of heart, when the sanctification is destroyed, the temple is desecrated, the altars are overturned, the light of the chandeliers is extinguished, the books are burned, the priests and Levites are captured, the virgins and wifes are defiled by hostile lust, all things holy are contaminated. For these things and things of this kind the remnant that have been saved lament not without cause when they see their people lose earthly goods no less than heavenly. So has the Lord indeed MADE A VINTAGE of her according to his just judgement, just as he has spoken in the law and the prophets.\n\nAllegorical interpretation O ALL YE: our Zion, whose conversation is in heaven, sees from heaven her limbs placed on earth, and beholds from the highest what they undergo every day, whence she, worthy of pity, cries out: O ALL YE THAT PASS BY THE WAY, the saints, to wit, of whom David says: Going they went and wept. They walk on THE WAY, that is Christ, following his steps, neither declining to the right nor to the left, for, summoned to the Paschal feast and celebrating the Paschal offerings, they consume the Lamb according to the law in haste. The Church looks at them, walking on the king’s highway that leads to the fatherland, she mourns, impeded by the many troubles of her children, and exclaims: O ALL YOU THAT PASS BY THE WAY, not to withdraw them from the way, but to incite them to pity: ATTEND with the mind, SEE with the intuition of charity, IF THERE BE ANY SORROW LIKE TO MY SORROW. A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow, whence the apostle: My little children, of whom I am in labor again. Indeed, the Church, who labors and begets, nourishes and gives suck, is sorrowful for everyone, whence: Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I am not on fire? So the Church gives suck to the tender, recalls the alienated, awaits the lazy, chastises the inconsiderate, for them to discern beforehand that the enemy will not find anyone outside the camp, when she, with her army well ordered, hurries to the heavenly fatherland. Hence: Who is she that goes up by the desert as the morning rising.\n\nTherefore, to the ones advancing or passing by, by the more noble limbs it is said: ‘O ALL YOU THAT PASS BY. Because there are different things, that I grieve for on their account. Different still, that I tolerate from those, that are without or within. I am forced abroad; in exile I linger. ATTEND, therefore, although unwearied devotion carries you to the prize. SEE my affliction. I wanted to rear children and bring them out of the misery of the exile and lead them to the joys of heaven, but many wander astray, many are obdurate, many are weary, there are few who care to come. I became all things to all men, so that I may gain every one. For every one I lament, for every one I am on fire. SEE, therefore, IF THERE BE ANY SORROW LIKE TO MY SORROW. Pitch your mind’s eye to the time of the final judgement and see, FOR the Lord HAS MADE A VINTAGE, that is he will make a vintage, OF ME IN THE DAY OF HIS FIERCE ANGER, of which it is said: O Lord, rebuke me not in thy indignation  , AS he SPOKE, for he will render to every man according to his works.’\n\nMoral interpretation O ALL YE: the soul, burdened by vices, yet not fully blinded, sees others with desire hurrying to the heavenly fatherland and pacing the way of virtue, and with tremendous sorrow she cries out: O ALL YOu THAT PASS BY THE WAY. As if: ‘see, with which vices I am wounded, with which dangers I am alarmed, with which tribulations I am dejected to which passions I am subject, FOR the Lord HAS MADE A VINTAGE OF ME. That is to say, he has, by his just judgement, taken away the goods of virtue, with which he adorned me like a bride, IN THE DAY OF HIS ANGER, provoked by my evils. YOU, therefore, THAT PASS BY THE WAY, you, that is, who disdain the present life, aiming towards the true way, that is Christ, SEE IF THERE BE ANY SORROW LIKE TO MY SORROW. I have lost the heavens, I have gathered up wrath for myself on Judgement Day and, burdened by my evils, I cannot hurry together with you to the joys of heaven.’\n"

Congratulating herself for which the Church calls herself chastised, to love chastely and to fear chastely, and she feels ashamed on account of those vices, to which she had zealously been devoted: ‘HE HAS SPREAD A NET, of preaching, that is, so that I should not go after errors of vanity and pleasures. HE HAS TURNED ME BACK, for me to go after him, and not before.’ This NET is entrusted to the apostles, for them to draw out fishes from the sea of this world. ‘FOR MY FEET, whence: I have restrained my feet from every evil way. HE HAS MADE ME DESOLATE of present goods, that previously were of comfort to me. WASTED WITH SORROW ALL THE DAY LONG: of pain, namely, for present tribulations and of love for the goods to come.’ \n \nMoral interpretation FROM ABOVE HE HAS SENT FIRE &c: while the soul is blamed by God for her sins, but coming to herself she is salubriously goaded by the stings of conscience and testifies that fire has come from the Lord INTO her BONES, that is into the marrow of her thoughts. Hence she is corrected from above and chastised and, as she senses the nets of God’s doctrines spread before her feet, she is TURNED BACK. She abstains from things unlawful, she turns concupiscence and debauchery of pleasure into tears and, WASTED WITH SORROW, the stronger she laments and receives no comfort from the present life, the more earnestly she considers herself to have erred through various desires.\n"

Around this idea three further notions are proposed.\n\nFirst is considered a diligent concorn about sin. As said\"\"My transgressions were bound into a yoke. That is, as one diligently considers a yoke of affliction, that must be interpreted as from effects of many sins. For, the prophet Jeremiah declares: \"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 'Jeremiah, what do you see?' and I said, 'I see a rod of almond\" (Jer l:ll).\n\nSecond is noticed the severe effect from the punishment. As expressed: \"by his hand they were fastened together\", Namely, such evils were like a chain, and unbreakable like a bond.\n\nThen: \"they were set upon my neck\". That is, while one suffers punishments for sins. As Psalm 38(37):4 exclaims: \"For my iniquities have gone over my head; they weigh like a burden too heavy for me.\"\n\nThird, an evasion of time is excluded, due to a weakness. As: \"he caused my strength to fail\". And, at another time, it was due to the enemy's power. For,\"the Lord gave me into the hands of those whom I cannot understand.\" Namely, the Chaldeans. Thus, Psalm 3l(30):l0 states: \"My strength fails because of my misery, and my bones waste away.\"\n"

        "txt": "IS WEAKENED: the sixth topic of complaint, as when looking forward to\nreceiving good from the Lord he fell into the greatest distress.\n\nHistorical interpretation THE YOKE HAS WATCHED: THE YOKE of iniquity is to sleep, to rest securely and unpunished in the numbness of negligence, but it watches in the HAND of the Lord, whence Jeremiah: I see a rod watching, to whom the Lord: I will watch over my word to perform it. Indeed, the sins are skulking for us being sluggish, but they watch in the HAND of the Lord, when they accuse us as revenge of just retribution. Hence: The voice of thy brother’s blood cries to me from the earth. THEY ARE FOLDED, just as a weight to press, AND PUT UPON MY NECK. Instead of a golden necklace she is encircled by a cord of iniquity, whence: Everyone is fast bound with the ropes of his own sins. Thus, she is given into the hands of the sinners, and she would not be able to rise, until the fullness of the gentiles enters, which NUN signifies, that is interpreted ‘everlasting’. Indeed, her yoke is everlasting, and her captivity eternal.\n\nAllegorical interpretation THE YOKE HAS WATCHED: when the Church is disturbed by temptations, the yoke of her iniquities watches IN THE HAND OF THE LORD, and she is subjected to her enemies, invisible as well as visible, the collars being dismissed with, that the bridegroom had given her for decoration, whence she says sighing: THEY ARE FOLDED TOGETHER AND PUT UPON MY NECK. Hence Isaiah says: Because the daughters of Zion have walked with stretched out necks, one ought to strip her of all embellishment and among other things chains and necklaces. Chains hanging on the breast show the understanding of the mind. Necklaces signify every embellishment, which when disposed of, the men of the Church in an effeminate affection walk about with stretched out necks, they speak with winks of the eyes, clapping their hands and feet, to step with ordered pace, pursuing worldly glory. She is therefore justly burdened by the yoke of her INIQUITIES, who is deprived of such embellishments of virtue, whence her iniquities, FOLDED with an indissoluble cord and PUT UPON her NECK, are lamented, with which some limbs are suffocated, as we read that Judas hanged himself with a halter. Hence is added: MY STRENGTH IS WEAKENED, because the impious will be given to everlasting death, where their worm dies not, and the fire is not extinguished. For just as the sentence above, which is entitled MEN, that is ‘from them’, which, namely, the Lord sends from heaven, turns her to penitence, so NUN, that is interpreted ‘everlasting’, drives her to destruction because of the yoke of her iniquities, so that, by the just judgement of God and according to her impenitent heart, she will fall into everlasting punishment. She charges herself and deplores, not that the Church, predestined to life, is given to these punishments, but that it happens to her own limbs.\n\nMoral interpretation THE YOKE HAS WATCHED: THE YOKE of the soul watches in THE HAND of the Lord, the soul, who has subjected herself to vices and evil deeds, unless she by making daily satisfaction puts them before her own eyes. Hence: My sin is always before me. For David wanted to watch and wash away his sins with tears, for their yoke not to stand watch in the hands of the Lord, whence: Turn away thy face from my sins. As if: ‘I wish not they would stand watch in your hand, but I watch against my sins and I atone for them with tears, for you not to put folded iniquities upon my neck, nor to deliver me ME INTO A HAND OUT OF WHICH I AM NOT ABLE TO RISE.’\n"

(cf Last part, 2 Kings (4 Kings), Chapter 25, \"The Exile of Judah\").\n\nSecond is exposed in particular the captivity of Judah under Sedecias, (Zedekiah, recorded in last chapter, 4 Kings). And in Jeremiah Chapter 52, (\"Judah Taken Captive at Babylon\"). As expressed in Verse 17 (\"Pe\"):l: \"Zion stretches out her hands but there is none to comfort her.\n\nRegarding the first captivity under King Jehoiachin, two further ideas are exposed. First is lamented the servitude of the people, second, a taking away of consolation. As further on exposed in Verse 16 (\"Ain\"):l: \"For these things I weep; my eyes flow with tears; for a comforter is far from me.\"\n\nTo lamentations over the people's servitude, three notions are advanced. First, servitude of people concerning those eminent in dignity. As expressed: \"The Lord flouted all my mighty men in the midst of me\". Namely, those leaders who do great deeds. For, to other men remaining, these were indeed captives. Hence, Isaiah 3:1 declares: \"For behold, the Lord of host, is taken away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.\"\n\nSecond, are taken away persons eminent in virtue. As said: \"he summoned an assembly against me\": those apt for destruction. Also: \"to crush my young men\". That is, young men eminent in virtue. Thus, Psalm 75(74):2 states: \"At the set time which I appoint I will judge with equity.\" And Exodus 32:34 says: \"Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.\" Also, Ecclesiastes 3:1. claims: \"For everything there is a season .\"\n\nThird, are taken into captivity persons eminent for purity and piety. As said: \"The Lord has trodden me as in a wine press, the virgin daughter of Judah.\" Namely, a literal affliction of a virgin-daughter. Or, of a tribe (of Judah) which, up until then, had been like a captured virgin-daughter. So, Jeremiah exclaims: \"The clamor will resound to the ends of the earth, for the Lord has an indictment against the nations.\" (Jer:25:3l).\n\nThus, this Verse 15 ought to be literally prescribed, as the \"Interlinear Gloss\" so asserts. Yet, what is prescribed in the following Verse 16 (\"Am\") seems better, as it is divided into three parts.\n"

In fact, during the Babylonian captivity they had Daniel and Ezekiel and many other comforters, but in this all the MIGHTY MEN are taken away, which SAMECH signifies, that is interpreted ‘aid’.

Indeed, in the whole city often few MIGHTY MEN remained, who would defend the cause of faith on the grounds of sound doctrine.\n\nHE HAS CALLED AGAINST ME THE TIME: faults requiring, the Lord brings forth the time of vengeance, to destroy her chosen men, because there is none to defend nor to set a wall before the house of Israel. \n\nMoral interpretation THE LORD HAS TAKEN AWAY ALL MY MIGHTY MEN &c: that is to say the senses of the virtues, which the soul discerns being held captive in herself, whence the Lord brings forth the time of vengeance against her, when he takes away his divine aid. When this has been removed, the enemy brings her as a captive into the confusion of error, and, while he makes her forget the preachers’ doctrine, he destroys the chosen efforts of the mind, so that he more easily may be master of her, deprived of virtues, as if in a foreign country, lest she would return through remembrance of sound dogma and an improvement of life to her original state.\n"

        "txt": "Repentance came by John, grace by Christ. He, as the Lord, gives the one; the other is proclaimed, as it were, by the servant. The church, then, keeps both that it may attain to grace and not cast away repentance, for grace is the gift of One who confers it; repentance is the remedy of the sinner.Jeremiah knew that penitence was a great remedy, which he in his Lamentations took up for Jerusalem and brings forward Jerusalem itself as repenting when he says, “She wept sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks, nor is there one to comfort her of all who love her. The ways of Zion do mourn.” And he says further, “For these things I weep, my eyes have grown dim with weeping, because he who used to comfort me is gone far from me.” We notice that he thought this the bitterest addition to his woes, that he who used to comfort the mourner was gone far from him. How, then, can you take away the very comfort by refusing to repentance the hope of forgiveness?\nBut let those who repent learn how they ought to carry it out, with what zeal, with what affection, with what intention of mind, with what shaking of the inmost bowels, with what conversion of heart: “Behold,” he says, “O Lord, that I am in distress; my bowels are troubled by my weeping; my heart is turned within me.”\nHere you recognize the intention of the soul, the faithfulness of the mind, the disposition of the body: “The elders of the daughters of Zion sat,” he says, “on the ground, they put dust on their heads, they girded themselves with haircloth, the princes hung their heads to the ground, the virgins of Jerusalem fainted with weeping, my eyes grew dim, my bowels were troubled, my glory was poured on the earth.”\nSo, too, did the people of Nineveh mourn and escaped the destruction of their city. Such is the remedial power of repentance, that God seems because of it to change his intention. To escape is, then, in your own power; the Lord wants to be asked, he wants people to hope in him, he wants supplication to be made to him. You are a human being, and you want to be asked to forgive, and you think that God will pardon you without asking him?\nThe Lord wept over Jerusalem, that, inasmuch as it would not weep itself, it might obtain forgiveness through the tears of the Lord. He wills that we should weep in order that we may escape, as you find it in the Gospel: “Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves.”\n"

        "txt": "THEREFORE DO I WEEP: the seventh topic of indignation; it displays a cruel and tyrannical deed and the violence of the enemies.\n\nHistorical interpretation He HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS: THE WINE-PRESS signifies vengeance and punishment for sin, whence Isaiah: Why then is thy apparel red and thy garments like theirs that tread in the wine-press; he introduces the Lord having answered the inquiring angels: I have trodden the wine-press alone, that, namely, with which punishments for the wicked and rewards for the just are trodden. This the Lord has trodden alone, as he had no helper, for neither angel nor archangel had assumed a human body, so that he, suffering for our sake, would crush and destroy the strength of our adversary. This WINE-PRESS THE LORD HAS TRODDEN in his passion FOR THE VIRGIN DAUGHTER OF JUDAH, that he would produce rewards for the believers and for the faithless and torturers punishments of perpetual captivity and everlasting damnation. The prophet, however, seeing the obduracy of the Jews, laments, because THE LORD HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS FOR THE DAUGHTER OF JUDAH. For that which the Lord suffers as her own remedy, she turns for herself into the torment of final captivity and everlasting damnation. Hence he introduces the person of the weeping Synagogue herself: THEREFORE DO I WEEP. THE COMFORTER IS FAR FROM ME: This we often demonstrate, if we consider the faithlessness and obduracy of the Jews. Metaphorically, however, it is said THE LORD HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS &c: figuratively, the Lord brought his vine out of Egypt and planted it in the land of promise, which for long remained barren and fruitless, according to this: I looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it hath brought forth wild grapes. Therefore THE LORD HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS, he has reserved wine for himself, he pressed the grape of swine through eternal captivity.\n\n Allegorical interpretation THE LORD HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS: when, namely, through his passion he brings the aerial powers under his Church. But she is really the virgin daughter of Judah, for the law hath come forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. For her THE LORD HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS, that is the yoke of oppression, that she might be free. But since the Lord is treading, many become the dregs of oil, therefore the prophet says weeping: MY EYES RUN DOWN WITH WATER, and thus AIN is put in between, that is interpreted ‘fountain-head’ or ‘eye’. For when he pressed the wine-press of the cross, a spring flowed out from his side, whence: and immediately there came out blood and water. In this spring the bride is gained and cleansed to be united to the embraces of her spouse, and with this she is endowed, that she might rejoice, that she might adhere to the spouse only, love him only, who has loved her so much. And, since AIN also is interpreted ‘eye’, the eye, inebriated from this spring, has not without cause run down with the water of tears, whence: My eyes have sent forth springs of water.\n\nTHE COMFORTER IS FAR: as often as the Church is inflicted with tribulations, as often as she is forsaken by the help of God, she ought to revert to tears, as if to accustomed defenses. When, however, a teacher giving instruction without and the helper is not present, who would furnish and educate her within, therefore ARE her CHILDREN DESOLATE and THE ENEMY HAS PREVAILED. Accordingly, any of the teachers who would have seen that the Church, entrusted to him, convert herself less, would drink from the spring of charity, whence he would produce tears, until he would have brought back the comforting and converting Paraclete. Otherwise, with the enemy prevailing, her CHILDREN shall become DESOLATE, who namely, not yet weaned, have not yet been brought to the perfect man.  \n\nMoral interpretation He HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS: THE LORD treads THE WINE-PRESS for the unfruitful soul, empty of virtues and works, when he strikes her, as if sterile and idle, with a wholly deservable expiation. Hence she says: THEREFORE DO I WEEP, because she sees that she has lost the comforter and that she falls impenitent, where there will be wailing and rattling of teeth. From which a great lamenting of the soul is described, that she might know that after the vain delight of this world all consolation will be wanting. There the children will be desolate, as the fruit of their evil deeds will be dispersed, and the enemy alone shall prevail.\n"

First, is the siege, or blockade, as bewailed, second the captivity itself. As further on said: \"The Lord is in the right for I have rebelled against his word.\" (Verse 18 \"Sade\").\n\nThird, is the corruption, due to a famine. As further on declared: \"I called to my lovers but they deceived me, my priests and elders perished in the city, while they sought food to revive their strength.\" (Verse 19 \"Coph\")\n\nRegarding the siege, or blockade, three further notions are made. First is reckoned a lack of friends, who could be of aid in preventing the siege. As declared: \"Zion stretches out her hands, but there is none to comfort her\" (V 17). That is, as if, seeking aid from the Egyptians. As finally expressed in Chapter 5:6: \"We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyris, to get bread enough.\" Or, also aid from the Lord God. As the prophet Isaiah expresses: \"When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you\" (Is 1:15).\n\nSecond, as to the captivity itself, the arrival of the enemy is considered in Verse 17: \"the Lord has commanded against Jacob that his neighbors should be his foes.\" Namely, like the Chaldeans. As Isaiah 10:6 proclaimed: \"and against the people of my wrath I commanded him to take spoil and seize plunder.\n\nThird, the consumption, due to famine, considers the management of the siege. As Verse 17 says finally: \"Jerusalem has become a filthy thing among them.\" That is, against Jerusalem, no one advances in order to defend it. As Jeremiah 2:2 declares: \"None who seek her need weary themselves; in her mouth they will find her.\"\n"

Indeed, it is the straightness of the heart that is expressed in the extension of the hands, more than with a cry from the mouth. Hence PHE is written before, that is interpreted ‘of the mouth’. Because, when ‘ZION HAS SPREAD FORTH HER HANDS in the midst of straits’, she shows that which she cannot express with her mouth, namely that she suffers in her heart, when she is without a comforter, whence: Depart from me, I will weep bitterly: labor not to comfort me.\n\nTHE LORD HAS COMMANDED AGAINST JACOB: with the just judgement of God, both the Chaldeans and the Romans have been brought in, for a people shall not arise against another unless God has previously given order. \n\nAS A MENSTROUS WOMAN: just as a woman is abominable, when she undergoes menstruation, likewise the Jews are looked upon over the whole world.  \n\nAllegorical interpretation SION HAS SPREAD FORTH HER HANDS: as often as the Church is surrounded by the army of heretics, THE LORD commands AGAINST JACOB, that is to say, the Church, who ought to overthrow her vices, the enemies’ armies against her, because she has dismissed the Holy Ghost, her teacher and comforter, without whom no one is educated to the faith, no one is freed from vices. Therefore HAS she SPREAD FORTH HER HANDS, in the midst of pressures and pains, and there is no worthy voice of the mouth for her, with which she would be able to overcome the dogmas of the enemies and defend her own, whence she is often polluted with the foulness of her carnal works and with the blood of her fleshly desires among the enemies, by whom she is afflicted within and without. Hence: Woe to them that are with child, and that give suck in those days.\n\nMoral interpretation SION HAS SPREAD FORTH HER HANDS: when the soul, who used to be a mirror of God and an over-thrower of vices, because of her iniquity is delivered to spiritual wickedness, she looks in vain for a comforter without, who has lost the spirit within. Justly therefore, THE LORD HAS COMMANDED AGAINST JACOB &c, that is against the soul, once overthrowing her vices, now bragging of the name only, whence her spiritual ENEMIES besiege her AROUND, that she cannot escape. She who often sees her surrounded, spreads FORTH HER HANDS in the midst of straits of thoughts, and there is no voice of the mouth for her, nor any excuse for speaking, because she is A MENSTROUS WOMAN, that is, stained with bloody deeds, from which she is never freed without the comforter, when also the prophet testifies to that all our justices are before him as the rag of a menstruous woman.\n"

Hence I have not put off confessing that THE LORD IS JUST.’ And note that above Jerusalem or the prophet invites them who passed by the way, as being rather few, to examine her pain, but now everyone is invited together, that theirs be one suffering, whose natural condition is one. Above he lamented the virgins in affliction and the children taken captives, but now also the stronger young men and the captured virgins, and the more evil is accumulated, the more sorrow is increased.\n\nHEAR I PRAY YOU ALL YE PEOPLE AND SEE MY SORROW: with great respect and acute consideration, these things are separated.  \n\nAllegorical interpretation THE LORD IS JUST: the Church, which above submitted to the judgement of his mouth and which in the divine Scriptures provoked the mouth of the Lord to wrath, is taught to confess: THE LORD IS JUST. Indeed, nothing upon earth is done without a cause, and nothing in God’s great commonwealth takes place without providence. \n\nFOR I HAVE PROVOKED HIS MOUTH: not that God should have human limbs, but just as human passions are metaphorically ascribed to him, so are also limbs. With MOUTH is signified the Word, brought forth from the Father’s mouth, as if he would say: ‘with my importunity I have provoked the just judge, and I have forced one of gentle nature to pass a grave sentence against me.’ HEAR, therefore, ALL YE PEOPLE: she rates her harm manifold and inestimable, whence she invites everyone to suffer together, so that with the compassion of the many, her anguish may be the lighter to bear. Her VIRGINS, of whom it is said: For I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ; her young men, whom Mother Church has begotten in the water of baptism, who when being corrupted by heretical crookedness, or defiled by vices, are captured, not in the place but in the mind, and taken to Babylon, that is to confusion. For he who is joined to a harlot, is made one body, then so much grief and so much affliction is accumulated, that he hardly is believed seen, or understood, by all. \n\nMoral interpretation THE LORD IS JUST: the soul, who is chastised by the judgement of his mouth, rightly confesses that THE LORD IS JUST, because with her shameful desires, she has provoked the mouth of the Lord to wrath, that he would put forth a grave sentence against her, he who is just in all his undertakings. Hence, imbued with her confusion, she dares not raise her eyes towards the angry judge, but invites every one to hear and see her affliction. Indeed, such is the passion of human nature that we seek partners in our pain or happiness, with whose partaking we endure more easily, whence: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost. The soul, therefore, is seeking several mediators, because she dares not even raise her eyes towards the judge, whom she has displeased. \n\nMY VIRGINS AND MY YOUNG MEN: she sees her clean thoughts and her firmer desires perish, as if with the enemy ravaging the progeny and hope of her womb, and she loses her hope of future generations.\n"

Also bad Catholics with power and authority, in whom the Church trusts as friends, often deceive her, and what is worse, they then rage more cruelly, when HER PRIESTS AND ANCIENTS PINED AWAY out of hunger for the word of God.

MY BOWELS ARE TROUBLED, like a woman in labor. I AM FULL: she points out, not that she is entirely touched, but that she is full of the BITTERNESS of sorrow and pain. MY HEART IS TURNED WITHIN ME by the weight of tribulation; THE SWORD of the persecutor; DEATH ALIKE, for the bitterness of tribulation.\n\nAllegorical interpretation BEHOLD, O LORD: RES is interpreted ‘of the head’. For the disorder of the bowels or the destruction of the heart is a sighing of the mind that is denoted in the head. Therefore it is justly said confusion ‘of the head’, when the Church is filled with bitterness due to the falling of her own, she who daily exhibits her pain and tribulation before the most clement judge. The bowels are the reservoir of all food, in which it is digested; by which those are understood, who do not neglect to conceal within and ruminate the bread, which comes down from heaven, just as clean flesh. They receive this food through faith, digest it with charity and meditating God’s law, whence Isaiah: Of fear, O Lord, we have conceived, and have brought forth wind. The Church deplores these bowels being disturbed, when she suffers various temptations and is vexed within and without.\n\nMY HEART IS TURNED WITHIN ME: namely because she does not put the seal of God upon her heart, whence: Put me as a seal upon thy heart. Indeed, if she had been sealed, the enemy would not have overthrown her. Thus, she is struck without by the sword of the persecutors, within by the doctrine of the heretics or the depravity of morals, which are more bitter than gall. \n\nMoral interpretation BEHOLD O LORD: the soul, troubled by various pains, mourns her bowels, that is her mind being disturbed, whence: The spirit of a man is the lamp of the Lord, which searches all the hidden things of the bowels, that is of the mind. This sighing of the head is therefore good, as the mind is represented by the head, whence Jeremiah says elsewhere: My bowels, my bowels are in part, and adds explaining: The senses of my heart are troubled within me. For the bowels signify the mind, because as in the bowels the offspring, so the thoughts in the mind. To be sure, the faithful soul, wearied by temptations, deplores herself weakened within and without; without by persecutions, within by pains. Indeed, when we are weakened on the outside by scourging, on the inside are we wearied by suggestions by the flesh, whence he adds: ABROAD THE SWORD DESTROYS, AND AT HOME THERE IS DEATH ALIKE.\n"

In fact, they rejoiced that she had been deprived the help of God, whom they envied standing firm among so many tempests. THAT THOU HAST DONE IT: she brings God’s judgement into the reckoning, from which she does not ignore that all things are ordered. THOU HAST BROUGHT A DAY OF CONSOLATION: these are the words of the prophet, who announces the forthcoming consolation to comfort the captured people as if it were something past, because he sees it so clearly. He speaks in a rhetorical manner, to procure the favor of the judge and to instigate against the enemies.\n\nAllegorical interpretation THEY HAVE HEARD: the Church deplores her own troubles and those of her friends, whence the letter SIN, which means ‘of teeth’, is placed before. This is the gnashing of teeth, of which it is read in the Canticles: Thy teeth as flocks of sheep that are shorn. They are those who do not need the milk on infancy but who chew solid bread, whence it is said to Peter: Kill and eat. As if: ‘I have served you not only bread to eat but creeping things.’ For such persons know, with the acuteness of doctrine, to kill vice and to lead creeping things to the body of Christ. Different, however, is the function of the teeth: Some divide, some diminish, others form words; thus others are mystical teeth, such as flocks of sheep that are shorn, who, deprived of old age, provide their offspring with the milk of doctrine and the garments of virtue. Others, whiter than milk, furnished with the beauty of their service, serve the Word to the utmost subtlety, whence the Apostle: Strong meat is for the perfect: for them who have their senses exercised. \n\nTHEY HAVE HEARD THAT I SIGH: the enemies hear the weeping spouse, who feels her absent husband, who, although always present through his majesty, suffers that his spouse is agitated by temptations, so that she is always alarmed and weak, that she may yield to the suggestion of the seducer. They have seen THAT I SIGH, which they always have wished, which they never have suspected. THERE IS NONE TO COMFORT ME, as the spirit of discipline shuns falsehood, and daily MY EVIL is multiplied. The demons are the enemies of the Church and heretics and false Christians. THAT THOU HAST DONE IT, whence: I am the Lord, I make peace, and create evil, that is allowing it by thy just judgement. THOU HAST BROUGHT A DAY OF CONSOLATION: this is more fit for the Church, because after the final captivity no consolation is left for the Jews. On Judgement Day, the Lord will render consolation for the just and punishments for the wicked. \n\nMoral interpretation THEY HAVE HEARD: the soul deplores that THE ENEMIES HAVE HEARD the evils she endures. THERE IS NONE TO COMFORT: it is an increase of pain to the anxious soul, because the one she puts her hope in postpones his succor. In addition, she suffers unutterably from the fact that the invisible enemies, who formerly flattered her, now mock her. Indeed, her conscience, by more seriously blaming, insults her, and the vices that used to seem sweet, become bitter. Those, however, who before seemed to be her friends and who ought to have shown pity, if they happened to know our crimes, now scorn her as if enemies. Hence David: They that watched my soul have consulted together, saying: God hath forsaken him. But the soul has teeth, that is virtues; thoughts, that know how to separate fortunate things from unfortunate and require the comforting Spirit and to hope for the pity of God, whence he adds: THOU HAST BROUGHT A DAY OF CONSOLATION. Indeed, the forceful soul knows that after the straits, the penitents will be given indulgence, and the insolent repayed with punishments.\n"

        "txt": "Historical interpretation LET ALL EVIL BE PRESENT: TAU is interpreted ‘signs’ in plural, as that is shown with this sign, to which many significant things refer. Hence: Mark Tau upon the foreheads of the men that sigh. In this the cross of Christ is understood, just as its own shape testify to, and as in Greek omega is the final letter, so in Hebrew TAU, whence the Lord says: I am Alpha and Omega: the Beginning and the End. Likewise TAU therefore signifies the cross, with which the foreheads are signed, as not to be slayed by the killers. TAU are therefore the signs of the cross, or rather it is the cross itself, whence it is placed upon the foreheads of the men that mourn, but then it was the sign of the future cross, now it is the cross itself. Besides, TAU is the last of the Hebrew letters, which are as many as the books of the Old Testament, for which they stand as signs. Indeed, as TAU is the last of the alphabet, so is the cross of Christ for those books, he who is the end of the law unto justice, and all those signs in the books are secrets of the Lord’s incarnation and our redemption. Therefore, by rights TAU is interpreted ‘signs’, so that through the same signs one thing may be announced, in which all signs are revealed, also of Lamentations, in which many signs of the judgements of God are gathered. In the end it is proper that the weeping and the suffering, in whose foreheads the cross is signed, have their toil made up for by the Lord, and for those who have persecuted them or have not wanted to recognize the signs of such a work, a worthy vengeance is bestowed. Hence it is said: LET ALL THEIR EVIL BE PRESENT BEFORE THEE, and to the letter it happened so. Read the prophets and you will find everything complete.\n\nAllegorical interpretation LET ALL EVIL BE PRESENT: as if: ‘why, O Lord, dost thou not revenge our blood? And revenge, O Lord, the blood of thy servants, which has been shed.’ MAKE A VINTAGE OF THEM: this will be fulfilled on Judgement Day, when the evil will receive what they deserve. But here, the impious take away temporal goods; in the future they will lose the eternal and just as they oppressed the saints, with the permission of God, they will, with God crushing, endure eternal afflictions. Which the Church fears and adds: FOR MY SIGHS ARE MANY.\n\nMoral interpretation LET BE PRESENT: the soul, unfolded in the presence of God, asks: LET ALL EVIL BE PRESENT, namely that they heap up within and without. LET it BE PRESENT BEFORE THEE, that I may evade by your succor, I who have no confidence in myself. MAKE A VINTAGE of all their deceit, that they may not take away my fruit from me, AS THOU HAST MADE VINTAGE OF ME, when you have withdrawn your gifts in anger FOR ALL MY INIQUITIES. As if: Thou art just, O Lord: and thy judgment is right. And these are signs through which all signs’ facts are miracles, whence: Thou hast given a warning to them that fear thee: that they may flee from before the bow. They, however, who do not want to take heed, rush upon this, that the Scripture threatens with, whence: Raise up indignation, and pour out wrath, hasten the time, and remember the end. As if: ‘O that the saints would not always be assailed, that each and every one would receive what he has done’, as if: Work new miracles, revealed according to the signs. Therefore, at the end of and before this lamentation, he has put the letter TAU, that is ‘signs’, and filled with tearful verses by foretelling the future.\n"

        "txt": "The destruction of the city, (Jerusalem), the people, and the entire city is lamented.\n\nSo, this Verse 1 is divided into two parts. First is deplored destruction itself, second the desperation of the people becomes exclusive. As later expressed in Chapter 3:1: \"1 am the.man who has seen affliction under the rod of his wrath\n\nThe idea of destruction itself has two views. First, misery from destruction is lamented, second, the inward destruction to oneself beseeches divine mercy. As the later Verse 18 says: \"Cry aloud to the Lord! O daughter of Zion.\"\n\nOn the misery from inward destruction to oneself two more notions are presented. First is lamented destruction in general, second in particular. As Verse 2 states: \"The Lord has destroyed without mercy all the habitations of Jacob.\"\n\nRegarding destruction in general it is wondered at, due to the multiple glory that preceeded it. First the prerogative as to divine knowledge. Since, Psalm (147):20: \"He has not dealt thus with any other nation; they donot know his ordinances. Praise the Lord!\"\n\nThe contrary is within Verse 1: \"How the Lord in his anger has set the daughter of Zion under a cloud!\" Namely, within ignorance and sadness. As Isaiah 59:9 declares: \"We look for light, and behold darkness, and for brightnes, but we walk in gloom.\"\n\nSecond is the particular destruction in relation to the power of royal dignity. The Book of I Esdras 4:20 so states: \"And mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, who ruled over the whole province Beyond the River, to whom trubute, custom, and toll were paid.\" Thus, Verse 1 continues: He hast cast down from heaven to earth the splendor of Israel.\"\n\nSuch is the end of royal dignity and power, or heavenly conversation. As Revelation 6:13 declares: \"and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale.\"\n\nThird is the destruction in reference to the cult of divine instruction, or religion. So Psalm l44(l43):15 claims: \"Happy the people to whom such blessings fall! Happy the people whose God is the Lord.\"\n\nIn contrary, Verse 1 records: \"he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.\" That is, not remembered in goodness, the footstool of his footstool, within which he (the Lord) is adored, like a king is reverenced around the footstool beneath his feet.\n\nAs the prophet Ezekiel 43:7 states: \"and he said to me, 'Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel for ever'\".\n"

Nor could any evil demon slander them or hinder them through human counsels, so long as the divine and heavenly hand watched over and guarded his people as worthy.But on account of the abundant freedom, we fell into laxity and sloth. We envied and reviled each other and were almost, as it were, taking up arms against one another. Rulers assailed rulers with words like spears, and people forming parties against people and monstrous hypocrisy and dissimulation rising to the greatest height of wickedness, the divine judgment with forbearance, as is its pleasure, while the multitudes yet continued to assemble, gently and moderately harassed the episcopacy.\nThis persecution began with the brothers in the army. But as if without sensibility, we were not eager to make the Deity favorable and propitious; and some, like atheists, thought that our affairs were unheeded and ungoverned; and thus we added one wickedness to another. And those esteemed our shepherds, casting aside the bond of piety, were excited to conflicts with one another and did nothing else than heap up fights and threats and jealousy and enmity and hatred toward each other, like tyrants eagerly endeavoring to assert their power. Then, truly, according to the word of Jeremiah, “The Lord in his wrath darkened the daughter of Zion, and cast down the glory of Israel from heaven to earth and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger. The Lord also overwhelmed all the beautiful things of Israel and threw down all his strongholds.”\nAnd according to what was foretold in the Psalms, “He has made void the covenant of his servant, and profaned his sanctuary to the earth—in the destruction of the churches—and has thrown down all his strongholds and has made his fortresses cowardice. All that pass by have plundered the multitude of the people; and he has also become a reproach to his neighbors. For he has exalted the right hand of his enemies, and has turned back the help of his sword and has not taken his part in the war. But he has deprived him of purification and has cast his throne to the ground. He has shortened the days of his time, and besides all, has poured out shame on him.”\nAll these things were fulfilled in us when we saw with our own eyes the houses of prayer thrown down to the very foundations. We saw the divine and sacred Scriptures committed to the flames in the midst of the marketplaces and the shepherds of the churches basely hidden here and there, and some of them were captured ignominiously and mocked by their enemies. When also, according to another prophetic word, “Contempt was poured out on rulers, and he caused them to wander in an untrodden and pathless way.”\n"

Onward in Verse 13 such is expressed: \"What can I say for you, to what compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem?\" etc.\n\nAs to events joined to destruction two ideas are advanced. First is bewailed the destruction of common edifices, second, the eminent edifices. As later Verse 6 comments: \"He has broken down his booth like that of a garden, laid in ruins the place of his appointed feasts.\"\n\nRegarding destruction of common edifices two further ideas are proposed. First is bewailed destruction itself, that pertains to the king's might, second, what pertains to the people's use. As further on Verse 4 says: \"He has bent his bow like an enemy; with his right hand set like a foe; and he has slain all the pride of our eyes in the tent of the daughter of Zion; he has poured out his fury like fire.\"\n\nTo the very destruction itself of edifices two more notions are set forth. First is bewailed destruction itself, second, the unavailing resistence. As Verse 3 states: \"He has cut down in fierce anger all the might of Israel; he has withdrawn from them his right hand in the face of the enemy.\"\n\nThree more ideas are again proposed as to destruction itself.

Verse 2 thus says: \"The Lord has destroyed without mercy all the habitations of Jacob.\" And, the prophet Joel 1:19 declares: \"Unto thee, O Lord, I cry. For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.\"\n\nSecond is lamented events pertaining to fortitude and courage. As Verse 2 continues: \"in his wrath he has broken down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. While the prophet Isaiah 25:12 says: \"And the high fortifications of his walls he will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground, even to the dust.\" Also, Jeremiah 33:4 records: \"For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah which were torn down to make siege mounds and before the sword.\"\n\nThird, the violent detriment of the kingdom is ended.\n\nAs Verse 2 concludes: \"he has brought down to the ground in dishonor the kingdom and its rulers.\" The prophet Ezekiel 28:8 exclaims: \"They shall thrust you down into the Pit, and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas.\"\n"

As said at the beginning of Verse 4: \"He has bent his bow like an enemy.\" That is like to a judgment, or the army of the Chaldeans, as if borne from afar.\n\nAnd: \"set like a foe: in order to strike with his right hand, as he presses near.\" As Psalm 7:12 asserts: \"If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and strung his bow.\"\n\nSecond, the infliction of punishment is considered. So, Verse 4 continues: \"and he has slain all the pride of our eyes.\" Namely, people's edifices, and other possessions. As Book of Numbers 24:5 asserts: \"How fair are your tents, O Jacob, your encampments, O Israel!\"\n\nThird, the magnitude of the punishment is shown, insofar to the extent without limits. As Verse 4 continues: \"in the tent of the daughter of Zion; he has poured out his fury like fire,\" That is, like harassment. Or, as Deuteronomy 32:22 says: \"For a fire is kindled\n\nby my anger, and it burns to the depths of Sheol, devours the earth and its increase, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.\" Also, Psalm 69(68):24: \"Pour out thy indignation upon them, and let thy burning anger overtake them.\"\n"

The first views the destruction of the very temple, second, is viewed those possessions within the temple. As Verse 7 states: \"The Lord has scorned his altar, disowned his sanctuary.\"\n\nThree notions are proposed as to the destruction of the temple itself. First is inferred the very destruction of the temple. As Verse 6 begins: \"He has broken down his booth\": that was made in the desert. In Silah had been placed the tabernacle which Solomom had constructed.\n\nThen, \"like that of a garden.\" That is, what is easily destroyed. As Psalm 78(77):60 states: \"He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among men.\" And, Jeremiah 26:6: \"Then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.\"\n\nSecond, the ending of temple feasts is touched upon. As said: \"laid in ruins the place of his appointed feasts; the Lord has brought to an end in Zion appointed feast and sabboth.\" (Verse 6). As if said: a feast acceptable before.

Thus, Verse 15 declares: \"All who pass along the way clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem.\"\n\nThird, is the condemnation of the divine judge, who instituted a vindication. As Verse 17 says: \"The Lord has done what he purposed, has carried out his threat.\"\n\nOn the cure for this plague, two more ideas are proposed. First is shown the incurable plague itself, second, a cause is assigned. As Verse 14 states: \"Your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive visions; they have not exposed your iniquity to restore your fortunes.\"\n\nOn the incurable plague itself two further notions are advanced. First is shown what cannot be lessened by human compassion with mere comparison to other plagues. For instance, human consolation for those afflicted.\n\nVerse 13 thus states: \"What can I say for you, to what compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem?\" Here a similitude is more than just a comparison. For, whatsoever distances of such reason are comparable, they are not distant \"ad infinitum\".\n\nNor, are such distances similiar, if contained within a like quality. Or, that all things have qualities, but only of those things of which one participating does not exceed the quality of another thing.\n\nNow, pains within other situations exceed in the fact regarding what is missing in both temporal and spiritual glory, that other nations, or peoples lack. As Verse 13 continues: \"What can I liken to you, that I may confort you, O Virgin daughter of Zion?\"\n\nThis states, as if: there is nothing worse, or similar to other persons, to what things suffered by you. For Chapter 1:21 says in conclusion: \"Bring thou the day thou has announded, and let them be as I am.\"\n\nSecond, is shown what cannot be cured medicinally, due to its magnitude. As verse 13 concludes: \"For vast as the sea is your ruin; who can restore you?\" Namely, the sea which is most wide and restless. For, Jeremiah 30:15 says: \"Why do you cry out over your hurt?

So, first is shown the falseness of prophets, while they foretell false ideas. As Verse 14 states: \"Your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive visions.\" That is they claim seeing what are proven,\" false and deceptive visions.\n\nNow, it had been stupid to believe the Lord God would not punish sinners. As the prophet Ezekiel 22:28 declares: \"And her prophets have daubed for them with whitewash, seeing false visions and divining lies for them.\" And, St Peter, the Apostle writes: \"But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you\" (2 Peter 2:1).\n\nThen, as to the above ideas prophets were silent. So Verse 14 continues: \"they have not exposed your iniquities to restore your fortunes\". Just like the prophet Isaiah 58:1 exclaims: \"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice like a trumpet; declare to my people their transgression, to the house of Jacob their sins.\"\n\nSecond, false visions, prophets see and are exposed. As Verse 14 concludes;\"but have seen for you oracles false and misleading\". Namely, like pressing burdens, like any burden from on high quite restricts anyone. For, Michah, the prophet states: \"Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who cry 'Peace' when they have something to eat.\" (Mic 3:5).\n\nRegarding.\"oracles false and misleading\" are false freedoms. As Jeremiah 28:11 says: \"And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, 'Thus says the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years'.\" Or: \"oracles\": that the Lord God will bring you to himself, \"misleading\", that he will cast your enemies aside.\n"

For, as incautious speaking leads into error, so indiscreet silence leaves in error those who might have been instructed. For often improvident rulers, fearing to lose human favor, shrink timidly from speaking freely the things that are right, and, according to the voice of the Truth, serve to the custody of the flock by no means with the zeal of shepherds but in the way of hirelings; since they fly when the wolf comes if they hide themselves under silence. For hence it is that the Lord through the prophet upbraids them, calling them, “Dumb dogs that cannot bark.” Hence again he complains, saying, “You have not gone up against the enemy, neither opposed a wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord.” Now to go up against the enemy is to go with free voice against the powers of this world for defense of the flock; and to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord is out of love of justice to resist bad people when they contend against us. For a shepherd to have feared to say what is right, what else is it but to have turned his back in keeping silence? But surely, if he puts himself in front for the flock, he opposes a wall against the enemy for the house of Israel. Hence again to the sinful people it is said, “Your prophets have seen false and foolish things for you: neither did they discover your iniquity, to provoke you to repentance.” For in sacred language, teachers are sometimes called prophets, in that, by pointing out how fleeting present things are, they point out the things that are to come. And these are the ones the divine discourse convinces of seeing false things, because, while fearing to reprove faults, they vainly flatter evildoers by promising security; neither do they discover the iniquity of sinners, since they refrain their voice from chiding. For the language of reproof is the key of discovery, because by chiding it discloses the fault of which even he who has committed it is often himself unaware.\n"

For, the Lord God prescribed destruction of his people: \"as he ordained long ago\" (cf Deuteronomy, Chapter 28: \"Consequences of Disobedience\").\n\nOr, such is even exposed by the very first prophets.

As Verse 20 says: \"Look, O Lord, and see! With whom hast thou dealt thus?\"\n\nRegarding an invitation to pray, two notions are proposed. First, one is taught to prepare a place for prayer through tears; second, one will be taught a manner of praying. As Verse 19 states: \"Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches.\"\n\nAround the place prepared for prayer three ideas are set forth. First, the reason for wailing, or lementing is exposed. As said: \"Cry aloud to the Lord! O daughter of Zion!\" Namely, regarding enemies.\n"

        "txt": "The Savior also wept over the city of Jerusalem because its inhabitants had not repented; and Peter washed out his triple denial with bitter tears, thus fulfilling the words of the prophet: “rivers of waters run down my eyes.” Jeremiah too laments over his impenitent people, saying, “O that my head were waters and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for … my people!” And farther on he gives a reason for his lamentation: “do not weep for the dead,” he writes, “neither bemoan him, but weep bitterly for him that goes away, for he shall return no more.” The Jew and the Gentile therefore are not to be bemoaned, for they have never been in the church and have died once for all (it is of these that the Savior says, “Let the dead bury their dead”15); weep rather for those who by reason of their crimes and sins go away from the church and who, suffering condemnation for their faults, shall no more return to it. It is in this sense that the prophet speaks to ministers of the church, calling them its walls and towers and saying to each in turn, “O wall, let tears run down.” In this way, it is prophetically implied, you will fulfill the apostolic precept: “Rejoice with them that rejoice and weep with them that weep.” By your tears you will melt the hard hearts of sinners until they too weep. However, if they persist in evildoing they will find these words applied to them: “I … planted for you a noble vine, wholly a right seed; how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?” He says again, “saying to a stock, you are my father; and to a stone, you have brought me forth; for they have turned their back to me, and not their face.” He means they would not turn toward God in penitence but in the hardness of their hearts turned their backs on him to insult him. Wherefore also the Lord says to Jeremiah, “Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree and there has played the harlot.” And I said after she had played the harlot and “had done all these things, Turn to me, but she returned not.”19How hardhearted we are, and how merciful God is! Even after our many sins, he urges us to seek salvation. Yet not even so are we willing to turn to better things.\n"

For in one way does that weeping originate that is caused by the pricks of our sins striking our heart, of which we read, “I have labored in my groaning, every night I will wash my bed; I will water my couch with my tears.” And again, “Let tears run down like a torrent day and night; give yourself no rest, and do not let the apple of your eye cease.” In another, that which arises from the contemplation of eternal good things and the desire of that future glory, owing to which even richer well-springs of tears burst forth from uncontrollable delights and boundless exultation, while our soul is thirsty for the mighty living God, saying, “When shall I come and appear before the presence of God? My tears have been my meat day and night,” declaring with daily crying and lamentation, “Woe is me that my sojourning is prolonged,” and, “Too long has my soul been a sojourner.”In another way do the tears flow forth, which without any conscience of deadly sin yet still proceed from the fear of hell and the recollection of that terrible judgment, with the terror of which the prophet was smitten and prayed to God, saying, “Enter not into judgment with your servant, for in your sight shall no one living be justified.” There is too another kind of tears, which are caused not by knowledge of one’s self but by the hardness and sins of others; whereby Samuel is described as having wept for Saul. Both the Lord in the Gospel and Jeremiah in former days wept for the city of Jerusalem, the latter thus saying, “O, that my head were water and my eyes a fountain of tears! And I will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people.” Or also such as were those tears of which we hear in Psalm 101: “For I have eaten ashes for my bread and mingled my cup with weeping.” And these were certainly not caused by the same feeling as those that arise in Psalm 6 from the person of the penitent but were due to the anxieties of this life and its distresses and losses, by which the righteous who are living in this world are oppressed. And this is clearly shown not only by the words of the psalm itself but also by its title, which runs as follows in the character of that poor person of whom it is said in the Gospel that “blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” “A prayer of the poor when he was in distress and poured forth his prayer to God.”\n"

For it will rather cast down the soul of the suppliant by his endeavors, and humiliate him, and plunge him in human affairs and draw him away from the celestial heights, wherein the awed mind of one who prays should be steadfastly fixed, and will force it to relax its hold on its prayers and grow sick from barren and forced tears.\n"

As expressed: \"Arise, cry out in the night\": that is, from sleep. \"Cry out \": namely, praise the Lord God. Then: \"in the night \": whence time is rather vacant and quiet, due to nighttime.\n\nAlso: \"at the beginning of the watches\". As vigils, or watches, within nighttime are so divided as to the guard of watchmen over the city. For, the Song of Solomon: 3:3 declares: \"The watchmen found me, as they went about the city.\"\n\nNow, there were four watches during the nighttime. The first watch: \"Canticunium\" (between cock-crowing and the dawn of day) is when the fire nightlamp is extinguished.\n\nThe second watch is termed: \"Intempestum\". It refers to the middle of the night. Such time is not opportune for action. For, among the ancients: \"what is 'timely', is a opportunely'.\"\n\nThe third watch is called the \"Crow\", or song of the cock. Finally, the fourth watch Is: \"Antehicanum\". That is, at the first vigil or watch, or at the beginning of any of the four watches. For Isaiah claims: \"My soul yearns for thee in the night, my spirit within me earnestly seeks thee.\" (Is: 26;9).\n\nTo devotion to one's heart Verse 19 declares: \"pour out your heart like water before the presence of the Lord!\" Namely, as one's heart liquifies thru love and devotion, as if once congealed, or frozen. As Psalm 42 (41):4 says: \"These things I remember, as I pour out my soul\".\n\nMoreover, there is another sign of devotion as Verse 19 continues: \"lift your hands to him\". Because, as I Timothy 2:8 says: \"I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling.\"\n\nSecond, the matter of prayer is viewed, as said: \"for the lives of your children\", That is, like to a separation of souls from bodies, as life itself in concerned.\n\nThen, Verse 19 concludes: \"at the head of every street.\" That is, like to the four ways of prayer that concur in one way. For, Chapter 2:11 Lamentations states: \"because infants and babes faint in the streets of the city.\"\n"

Thus, Verse 22 says: \"Thou didst invite as to the day of an appointed feast my terrors on every side.\"\n\nRegarding inhumanity in punishment two more ideas are proposed. First, is the attention: \"with whom thou hast dealt thus?\" This states, as if, no other person except me, for they are elected from the fathers, or elders. For Chapter 1:12 says: \"which the Lord inflicted on the day of his fierce anger.\"\n\nSecond is considered inhumanity of punishment counter to national piety. Since, Verse 20 asks: \"should women eat their offspring, the children of their tender care?\" This asks, as if, will you (O Lord) ever sustain this (situation). For, it is read that such a situation is fulfilled in the blockade of the Romans against Joseph (son of Jacob and Rachel) of Egypt. (cf: Also, Chapters 5-7, Book of 2 Kings (4 Kings), (\"The Siege of Samaria by the Syrians.\"). Also, it is stated in Chapter 4:10: \"The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.\"\n\nThen, there is inhumanity even counter to honesty, and integrity of religion itself. So expressed in Verse 20: \"Should priest and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?\" Which states, as if: Will you ever sustain what is murdered? And, as the prophet Ezekiel 9:6 declares: \"but touch no one upon whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary.\"\n"

For, Jeremiah 51:22 declares: \"with you I break in pieces man and woman; with you I break in pieces the old man and the youth; with you I break in pieces the young man and the maiden.\"\n\nSecond, the indignation of the person punishing is reckoned.

So, that, by you, (Lord) inspiring, they come to obey you. For, Isaiah 29:3 declares: \"And I will encamp against you round about, and I will besiege you with towers and I will raise siegeworks against you.\"\n\nSecond, the impossibility of escaping is noticed.

        "txt": "After an enumeration of many penalties ( in Chapter 2) the despair of the people is excluded. Such exclusion is divided twofold.\n\nFirst, despair is considered by appeals, second, is the argument for a fidelity that must be acceptable. As Verse 19 later states: \"Remember my affliction and my bitterness, the wormwood and the gall.\" Third, an assumed faithfulness turns the people to prayer for (divine) mercy. Like expressed further on in Verse 37: \"Who has commanded and it came to pass, unless the Lord has ordained it?\"\n\nOn despair on appeals three ideas are conveyed. First is set forth affliction itself, second a reprobation is assumed. As later Verse 17 says: \"My soul is bereft of peace, I have forgotten what happiness is\".\n\nThird, despair is concluded in Verse 18: \"So I say, 'Gone is my glory, and' my expectation from the Lord'.\"\n\nTo the first idea (affliction itself) two further notions are added. First, the affliction is considered which people sustained through pressure of their hands. And second, the manner of this very affliction is viewed. Like Verse 4 says: \"He has made my flesh and my skin waste away, and broken my bones\n\nThird, a remedy for their escape is left out. Verse 7 so says: \"He has walled me about so that I cannot escape; he has put heavy chains on me.\"\n\nTo the affliction sustained by the pressure of hands, three more ideas are advanced. First indignation is noticed of the person pressing hands. Verse 1 then states: \"I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of his wrath.\" Jeremiah himself here is speaking in his own person, for he himself has been afflicted like other persons, concerning whom he repudiates their misery. For, Revelations 3:17 claims: \"For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing; not knowing that you are wretched, piteable, poor, blind and naked.\" Thus allegorically such can be expressed about Christ and his Church. Morally, it can refer to human souls.\n\nSecond, a subtraction of consolation is viewed. Verse 2 so states: \"He has driven and brought me into darkness without any light.\" Since, after blows, no consolation is offered in the accustomed manner. Thus, Job 3:23 asks: \"Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, whom God has hedged in?\"\n\nThird is the condition for the blows, stated in Verse 3: \"Surely against me he turns his hand again and again the whole day long\". Namely, there follows a sequence of affliction that considers such blows alone.\n\nVerse 3 again: \"Surely against me he turns his hand again and again the whole day long.\" That is, striking blows again and again. Hence, Isaiah 9:12: \"For all this, his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.\"\n"

So, about this are three more views.\n\nFirst is the weakening of powers of an entire people. For: \"He has made my flesh\": 'by which people eternally existing: ftand my skin waste away\": in which are delicate bones. Also: \"my bones\": in which are a strong warrior people. So, the Book of Baruch 3:10 says: \"Why is it, O Israel, why is it that you are in the land of your enemies that you are growing old in a foreign country?\"\n\nSecond is the siege of those people already weakening. Since Verse 5 reports: \"He has besieged and enveloped me,\" Namely, the besieging army: \"with bitterness and trubulation.\" That is, by an army that inflicts labor and bitterness on me. As Job 7:12 asks: \"Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that thou settest a guard over me?\"\n\nThird, the imprisonment of those persons captured is considered. As expressed in Verse 6: \"He has made me dwell in darkness like the dead of long ago.\" And Psalm 143 (l42):3 says: \"he has made me sit in darkness like those long dead.\"\n\nThus, these ideas canbe referred to the prophet Jeremiah himself. Since, he himself has been confined by many obstacles, and also against his own body, and hidden in a prison.\n"

So, Verse 7 states: \"He has walled me about so that I cannot excape.\" That is, by the besieging army.\n\n\"He has put heavy chains on me.\" This indicates that I (Jeremiah) am besieged just like those persons who are sent to prison and cannot escape. Thus, Psalm 88(87):8 claims: \"I am shut in so that I cannot escape.\" And Job 13:27 says: \"Thou puttest my feet in the stocks, and watchest all my paths.\"\n\nSecond, is cut off a remedy for escape, due to an exclusion of prayer. For Verse 8 states: \"Though I call and cry for help, he shuts out my prayer.\" And, as Psalm 22(2l):2 says: \"O my God, I cry by day, but thou dost not answer; and by night, but find no rest.\"\n\nThird, a remedy for escape is cut off due to a hinderance in counselling. As Verse 9 so expresses: \"He has blocked my ways with hewn stones, he has made my paths crooked\", Namely, he has blocked counsels for escaping: \"with hewn stones\": like to heavy impediments. The\n\nprophet Hosea thus claims: \"Therefore I will hedge up her way with thorns; and I will build a wall against her so that she cannot find her paths.\" (Hosea 2:6).\n"

First is the insidious action of enemies. So Verse 10 says: \"He is to me like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding.\" Just like Nabuchodonosor fighting against me ( Jeremiah), from ambush (cf. Old Babylon Empire; around 1140 B.C; or Ruler of New Babylon Empire, around 605-562 B.C.).\n\nThen, Verse 10: \"He is to me like a bear\": cruel, and \"like a lion\": in which is designated the above ruler (Nabuchodonosor). As the prophet Hosea relates: \"So I will be to them like a lion, like a leopard I will lurk beside the way\" (Hos 13:7).\n\nSecond, ambushes, or plots of such enemies whom they would repell. As Verse 11: \"He led me off my way and tore me to pieces.\" As expressed in Chapter 1:13 \"he has left me stunned, faint all the day long.\"\n\nThen Verse 12: \"He bent his bow and set me as a mark for his arrow.\" Here is displayed what is publicly and openly added to the very manner.\n\nAbout this above idea three more notions are added. First is exposed the proposal: \"He bent his bow and set me.\" Namely, like to a judgment, or to an army of enemies. For Psalm 7:12 states: \"he has bent and strung his bow\". And Job: 16:12: \"he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target.\"\n"

And since Psalm 102 (lOl):9 declares; \"For I eat ashes like bread, and mingle tears with my drink.\"\n\nVerse 17 then states: \"My soul is bereft of peace.\" Here is assumed a rejection: My soul is bereft\": of God's divine mercy. Like Psalm 89(88)':39 declares: \"Thou has renounced the covenant with thy servant; thou hast defiled his crown in the dust.\"\n\nVerse 17 concludes: \"I have forgotten what hap piness is\". Namely, due to the experience of evils. For, Sirach 11:27 claims: \"The misery of an hour makes one forget luxury.\"\n"

As expressed in Verse 34: \"To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth.\" Third, by divine power. Which Verse 37 expresses: \"Who has commanded and it came to pass, unless the Lord has ordained it?\"\n\nTo the exclusion of despair by divine mercy, two further ideas are exposed. First, isshown mercy regarding a collection of benefits, second regarding a relaxation of punishments. As Verse 31: \"For the Lord will not cast off forever.\"\n\nReferring to divine mercy towards the collection of benefits three more notions are advanced. First is the memory of past benefits, second, the experience of present benefits. Verse 22 so states: \"The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.\" Third, is the expectation of future benefits. Verse 25 thus states: \"The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.\"\n\nFor the memory of past benefits three more ideas are referred to. First, the memory induces prophets towards God, as to a due consideration of evils encountered. While saying: O Lord God you seem dissimulating while forgetting us. So, \"remember my affliction\": freeing us from affliction, as to loss of possessions. And: \"my bitterness\": as to my fault that is the cause of so much misery. Also: \"the wormwood and the gall,\" an affliction upon humankind.\n\nSecond, memory reduces itself to the benefits the people received. For Verse 20 states: \"My soul continually thinks of it\", the benefits.\n\nAnd: \"is bowed down within me\". That is, memory fails from admiration, or desire. As Psalm 42 (41):4 says: \"These things I remember, as I pour out my soul.\"\n\nThird, memory results regards faithfulness. For Verse 21 claims: \"But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope.\" Hence Sirach 51:8 says.\"Then I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy work from of old.\"\n"

Since the Lord punished worthily, not reducing his creations backwards to extinction, or nothingness. Thus, Jeremiah 10:24 declares: \"Correct me, O Lord, but in just measure; not in thy anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.\"\n\nSecond, an approbation from the Lord's divine mercy is indicated. For, Verse 23 says: \"They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness.\" Namely, as I, the Lord God, openly approve. Again: \"great is their faithfulness\". That is, regarding Jeremiah, who, among your suppliants, acknowledge you. For, the Apostle Matthew reports: \"Then Jesus answered her, 'O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire'.\" (Mt: 15:28).\n\nThird, there is an intended conclusion: \"The Lord is my portion\": my soul says: \"Therefore I will hope in him\". Namely, since I (Jeremiah) choose his divine mercy in portions while others despise it. As said in Psalm 16 (15):5: \"The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup; thou holdest my lot.\"\n"

Let us see now if, in the Old Testament, the God of the prophets and the Creator and Legislator of the word is not called good. What are the expressions that occur in the psalms? “How good is God to Israel, to the upright in heart!” and, “Let Israel now say that he is good, that his mercy endures for ever,” the language in the Lamentations of Jeremiah, “The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.” As therefore God is frequently called good in the Old Testament, so also the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is styled just in the Gospels. Finally, in the Gospel according to John, our Lord, when praying to the Father, says, “O just Father, the world has not known you.” And lest perhaps they should say that it was owing to his having assumed human flesh that he called the Creator of the world Father and styled him just, they are excluded from such a refuge by the words that immediately follow, “The world has not known you.” But, according to them, the world is ignorant of the good God alone. For the world unquestionably recognizes its Creator, the Lord saying that the world loves what is its own. Clearly, then, he whom they consider to be the good God is called just in the Gospels. Anyone may at leisure gather together a greater number of proofs, consisting of those passages, where in the New Testament the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is called just, and in the Old also, where the Creator of heaven and earth is called good; so that the heretics, being convicted by numerous testimonies, may perhaps some time be put to the blush.\n"

He will certainly appear and scatter the wolves and glorify the shepherds. “The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.” Let us not murmur at the storm that has arisen, for the Lord of all knows what is good for us. Wherefore also when the apostle asked for release from his trials he would not grant his supplication but said, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.” Let us then bravely bear the evils that befall us; it is in war that heroes are discerned, in conflicts that athletes are crowned, in the surge of the sea that the art of the helmsman is shown, in the fire that the gold is tried. And let us not, I beseech you, heed only ourselves; let us rather have forethought for the rest, and that much more for the sick than for the whole, for it is an apostolic precept that exclaims, “Comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak.” Let us then stretch out our hands to them that lie low, let us tend their wounds and set them at their post to fight the devil. Nothing will so vex him as to see them fighting and striking again. Our Lord is full of lovingkindness. He receives the repentance of sinners. Let us hear his words: “As I live, says the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.” So he prefaced his words with an oath, and he who forbids oaths to others swore himself to convince us how he desires our repentance and salvation. Of this teaching the divine books, both the old and the new, are full, and the precepts of the holy Fathers teach the same.But not as though you were ignorant have I written to you; rather have I reminded you of what you know, like those who standing safe on the shore help those who are tossed by the storm and show them a rock, or give warning of a hidden shallow or catch and haul in a rope that has been thrown. “And the God of peace shall bring Satan under your feet shortly” and shall gladden our ears with news that you have passed from storm to calm, at his word to the waves, “peace be still.” And you also should offer prayers for us, for you who have undergone peril for his sake can speak with greater boldness.\n"

First is the result of such an expectation:\n\n\"The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.\" That is, as if spreading proper posessions. Since, Psalm 73 (72):l claims: \"Truely God is good to the upright, to those who are pure in heart.\"\n\nSecond, the manner of this expectation is noticed. As said: \"It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord.\" Namely, patiently, and without a murmur. For Isaiah 30:15 asserts: \" in quietness and c in trust shall be your strength.\"\n\nThird, the time of this expectation is examined: \"It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.\" That is, a fear of the Lord, and love for the Lord in his youth. Since, as the ardor of time is lessened, and youth is more easily led towards virtue. Like Proverbs 22:6: \"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.\"\n"

And Christ also said to his disciples, “In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer.” And again, “You shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice.” And again, “Narrow and straitened is the way.” Do you see how tribulation is everywhere lauded, everywhere assumed as needful for us? For if in the contests of the world, no one without this receives the crown unless he fortifies himself by work, by abstinence from the finer things of life, by living according to rule, by being vigilant, and innumerable other things, much more so here. For whom will you name as an instance? The king? Not even he lives a life free from care, but one burdened with much tribulation and anxiety. For look not to his diadem but to his sea of cares, by which the crown is produced for him. Nor look to his purple robe but to his soul, which is darker than that purple. His crown does not so closely bind his brow, as care does his soul. Nor look to the multitude of his spearmen but to the multitude of his disquietudes. For it is not possible to find a private house laden with so many cares as a king’s palace. Violent deaths are each day expected, and a vision of blood is seen as they sit down to eat and drink. Nor can we say how often he is disturbed in the night and leaps up, haunted with visions. And all this in peace; but if war should overtake him, what could be more piteous than such a life as this! What evils has he from those that are his own, I mean, those who are under his dominion. In actuality, the pavement of a king’s house is always full of blood, the blood of his own relations.… But as I said, life cannot be without pain.

For who is there who does not receive through the eyes, through the ears, through the taste and smell and touch, pleasures and delights, so as to become impatient of the control of continence as a driver, who checks and vehemently restrains the horse from evil?

For thus, in the Lamentations of Jeremiah, it is said, “It is good for a person that he bear the yoke in his youth: he sits alone and keeps silence, because he has borne it on him.

So, then, we infer that neither “Jesus nor Moses has taught falsely.” The Father in sending Jesus did not “forget the commands that he had given to Moses”: he did not “change his mind, condemn his own laws and send by his messenger counter instructions.”\n"

First, regarding a height for contemplation: \"Let him sit alone in silence when he has laid it on him.\" Namely, that he be not impeded by turmoil within thought. Since, through such turmoil,\"he had laid it on him.\" That is, for a consideration of divine favors. As Hosea, the prophet concludes: \"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.\" (Hos: 2:14). Besides, there is displayed turmoil through a rejection of the person expecting, while such a one awaits. It says: \"Let him sit alone in silence.\" Since, cast aside: \"when he has laid it on him.\"\n\nSecond, the condition of the person expecting refers to humbleness of location. Saying: \"Let him put his mouth in the dustthere may yet be hope.\" Namely, while humbly speaking. Since Isaiah 29:4 reflects: \"Then deep from the earth you shall speak, from low in the dust your words shall come.\"\n\nThird, the condition of the person expecting can refer to their patience in tribulation. As expressed: \"Let him give his cheek to the smiter, and be filled with insults.\" That is, be prepared to give: \"his cheek to the smiter\". For the Apostle Matthew states: \"but if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.\" (Mt: 5:39). Also: \"and be filled with insults\". Namely, a person should delight, as if being spared some fault by his own action. For, St Paul exclaims to the Romans: \"More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance\". (Rorn: 5:3). And Isaiah 50:6 asserts: \"I gave my 'back to the smiters, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard.\"\n"

His indignation, then, is not the carrying out of vengeance but rather the working out of forgiveness, for these are his words: “If you shall turn and lament, you shall be saved.” He waits for our lamentations here, that is, in time, that he may spare us those that shall be eternal. He waits for our tears that he may pour forth his goodness. So in the Gospel, having pity on the tears of the widow, he raised her son. He waits for our conversion that he may himself restore us to grace, which would have continued with us had no fall overtaken us. But he is angry because we have by our sins incurred guilt in order that we may be humbled; we are humbled in order that we may be found worthy rather of pity than of punishment.Jeremiah, too, may certainly teach us this when he says, “For the Lord will not cast off forever; for after he has humbled, he will have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies, he who has not humbled from his whole heart or cast off the children of humankind.” This passage we certainly find in the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and from it, and from what follows, we note that the Lord humbles all the prisoners of the earth under his feet, in order that we may escape his judgment. But the one who does not bring down the sinner even to the earth with his whole heart is also the one who raises the poor even from the dust and the needy from the dunghill. For he does not wholeheartedly bring down those he intends to forgive.\nBut if he does not wholeheartedly bring down every sinner, how much less does he wholeheartedly bring down someone who has not sinned with his whole heart! For as he said of the Jews, “This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me,” so perhaps he may say of some of the fallen, “They denied me with their lips, but in their heart they are with me. It was pain that overcame them, not unfaithfulness that turned them aside.” But some without cause refuse pardon to those whose faith the persecutor himself confessed up to the point of striving to overcome it by torture. They denied the Lord once but confess him daily; they denied him in word but confess him with groans, with cries and with tears; they confess him with willing words, not under compulsion. They yielded, indeed, for a moment to the temptation of the devil, but even the devil afterwards left those whom he was unable to claim as his own. He yielded to their weeping, he yielded to their repentance, and after making them his own lost those whom he attached when they belonged to Another.\n"

He said, “I bring my body into subjection, lest when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.” They would easily have borne the afflictions that were brought on them to prove them from time to time, if the prophetic admonition had been listened to by them: “It is good for a person to take up your yoke in his youth. He shall sit alone and shall be silent, because he has taken your yoke on him. He will give his cheek to him who strikes him. He will be filled with reproaches. The Lord does not cast away forever. When he abases, he is gracious, according to the multitude of his tender mercies.” For though all these things should proceed from the enemies, stripes, insults, reproaches, yet shall they avail nothing against the multitude of God’s tender mercies; for we shall quickly recover from them since they are merely temporal, but God is always gracious, pouring out his tender mercies on those who please him. Therefore, my beloved, we should not look at these temporal things but fix our attention on those that are eternal. Though affliction may come, it will have an end; though insult and persecution, yet are they nothing to the hope that is set before us. For all present matters are trifling compared with those that are future; the sufferings of this present time not being worthy to be compared with the hope that is to come. For what can be compared with the kingdom? Or what is there in comparison with life eternal? Or what is all we could give here, to that which we shall inherit yonder? For we are “heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.” Therefore it is not right, my beloved, to consider afflictions and persecutions but the hopes that are laid up for us because of persecutions.\n"

Because Psalm 94 (93):14 claims: \"For the Lord will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage.\" And Isaiah 28:28 remarks: \"Does one crush bread grain? No, he does not threst it forever.\"\n\nSecond, divine mercy, in relation to divine piety as to reason, is considered. For, though the Lord causes grief, he will have compassion according \"to the abundance of his steadfast love\", because, it from such a portion of divine piety (of God the Father) that one punishes in order to correct, then one comforts. For, the Book of Tobit 4:21 states: \"Do not be afraid, my son, because we have become poor. You have great wealth, if you fear God and refrain from every sin and do what is pleasing in his sight.\" Therefore, out of love for humankind is said: \"For he does not willingly afflict or grieve the Sons of men.\" That is, he apportions from his divine love.

In the psalm, too, it is said, “I was a peacemaker among them who hated peace,” and in many similar passages. In connection also with our imitating God in refraining from taking revenge and in loving even the wicked, there is a passage containing a full description of God in this character, for it is written, “To you alone ever belongs great strength, and who can withstand the power of your arm? For the whole world before you is as a little grain of the balance; yes, as a drop of the morning dew that falls down on the earth. But you have mercy on all, for you can do all things and wink at the sins of people, because of repentance. For you love all things that are and abhorred nothing that you have made; for never would you have made anything if you had hated it. And how could anything have endured, if it had not been your will? or been preserved, if not called by you? But you spare all; for they are yours, O Lord, you lover of souls. For your good Spirit is in all things; therefore chasten little by little those who offend. Warn them by reminding them of the ways in which they have offended, so that learning their wickedness, they may believe in you, O Lord.” Christ exhorts us to imitate this long-suffering goodness of God, who makes the sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust; that we may not be careful to revenge but may do good to them who hate us, and so may be perfect, even as our Father in heaven is perfect. From another passage in these ancient books we learn that, by not exacting the vengeance due to us, we obtain the remission of our own sins. By not forgiving the debts of others, we incur the danger of being refused forgiveness when we pray for the remission of our own debts: “He who revenges shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sin in remembrance. Forgive your neighbor the hurt that he has done to you; so shall your sins also be forgiven when you pray. One person bears hatred against another, and does he seek pardon of the Lord? He shows no mercy to a person who is like himself; and does he ask forgiveness of his own sins? If he who is but flesh nourishes hatred and asks for favor from the Lord, who will entreat for the pardon of his sins?”\n"

And when Jesus beheld her and perceived from what cause she was bowed together, he said, “Ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?” And how many others are still bowed down and bound by Satan, who hinders them from looking up and who would have us to look down also! And no one can raise them up, except the Word that came by Jesus Christ and that inspired the prophets: And Jesus came to release those who were under the dominion of the devil; and, speaking of him, he said with that depth of meaning that characterized his words, “Now is the prince of this world judged.” We are, then, indulging in no baseless calumnies against demons but are condemning their agency on earth as destructive to humankind, and we show that, under cover of oracles and bodily cures and such other means, they are seeking to separate from God the soul that has descended to this “body of humiliation, and those who feel this humiliation exclaim, “O wretched being that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?”\n"

For it is the mind of each individual that is the cause of the evil that arises in him, and this is evil (in the abstract); while the actions that proceed from it are wicked, and there is, to speak with accuracy, nothing else in our view that is evil.

And even up to human kind, due to a conformity of human nature to God, (the Creator).\n\nAs Rabbi Maimonides asserts: \"here and now, each and all particulars the Lord God does not actually acknowledge\". (cf. Moses ben Maimon, (1135-1204 C.E.: Torah and Talmud exegete, author: \"More Nebukim, Dalalat al hairin: Guide for the Perplexed).\n\nThen, Verse 38 asks: \"Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that good and evil come?\" Namely from good results prosperity, from bad results adversity. For, in such an idea is excluded the error of those persons who claim everything happens from chance, like Cicero, the Roman philosopher (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 B.C.). However, the apostle and evangelist John 1:3 asserts: \"All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that was made.\" And the prophet Isaiah 45:7: asserts the Lord God: \"I form light and create darkness, I make weal and create woe, I am the Lord, who do all these things.\"\n\nSecond, arguments are advanced regarding divine power against persons who deride the above ideas, through impatience within inurmurings. As: \"Why should a living man complain; a man, about the punishment of his sins?\" Namely, as to his known sins, from which he now suffers. For, Wisdom 1:11 declares: \"Beware then of useless murmuring, and keep your tongue from slander.\"\n"

Deservedly, therefore, even while in the flesh, did the Lord show himself to him, the colleague of his own fasts, no less than to Elijah. For Elijah had, by this fact primarily, that he had imprecated a famine, already sufficiently devoted himself to fasts: “The Lord lives,” he said, “before whom I am standing in his sight, if there shall be dew in these years and rain shower.” Subsequently, fleeing from threatening Jezebel, after one single meal of food and drink, which he had found on being awakened by an angel, he too, in a space of forty days and nights, his belly empty, his mouth dry, arrived at Mount Horeb; where, when he had made a cave his inn, with how familiar a meeting with God was he received! “What are you doing here, Elijah?” Much more friendly was this voice than, “Adam, where are you?” For the latter voice was uttering a threat to a fed man, the former soothing a fasting one. Such is the prerogative of circumscribed food, that it makes God tent fellow with a man—peer, in truth, with peer! For if the eternal God will not hunger, as he testifies through Isaiah, this will be the time for a person to be made equal with God, when he lives without food.\n"

        "txt": "Faith being restored, one now turns to divine mercy. Two further ideas are added to this idea. First, a preparation for prayer is considered, second, the prayer itself. As said: \"We have transgressed and rebelled, and thou hast not forgiven\" (Verse 42).\n\nOn preparation for prayer, a place is afforded through change of life. As remarked: \"Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the Lord.\" That is, by searching out our past sins. Again : \"Let us test and examine our ways.\" Namely, as to the Lord God, in a desire of our heart seeking divine aid. Then, accepting such one can return to the Lord God by doing good deeds. Since, Jeremiah claims: \"know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the Lord your God\" (Jer: 2:19).\n\nSecond, a place for prayer is prepared through devotion. As said: \"Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven.\" For, Paul the Apostle beseeches: \"I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling\" (I Tim: 2:8).\n\nVerse 42 then states: \"We have transgressed and rebelled, and hast not forgiven.\" Here prayer begins, first accenting benevolence, second, the fault. Later Verse 59 thus says: \"Thou hast seen the wrong done to me, O Lord; judge thou my cause.\"\n\nThird, a place for prayer is prepared, by seeking vindication. For Verse 64 later states: \"Thou wilt requite them, O Lord, according to the work of their hands.\"\n\nAs to an accent on benevolence three futher ideas are proposed. First, benevolence is accented thru their own person, and conquered people; second, as to enemies. For, Verse 46 says: \"All our enemies rail against us.\"\n\nThird, is the person of the judge. As Verse 55 states: \"I called on thy name, O Lord, from the depths of the pit.\"\n\nHere Verses 40-42 take into account a benevolence of their own person and people, setting forth their harassments. First, afflictions of people are considered, second compassion. Verse 49 thus says: \"My eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite.\"\n\nRegarding afflictions of people are two further ideas. First, is conferred their fault, lest following punishment, a discretion of a judge is directed. For, Verse 42 claims: \"we have transgressed and rebelled, and thou has't not forgiven.\" Namely, by sinning against our neighbor. Also: \"and rebelled\": by sinning against God.\n\nAnd then: \"and thou hast not forgiven\". Since, you, Lord God, are inflexible towards our prayers. Thus, Jeremiah says: \"As for you, do not pray for this people, or lift up cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I do not hear you\" (Jer: 7:16). Also, the apostle John points out: \"We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, God will listen to him\" (Jo 9:31).\n\nSecond, regarding the people's afflictions, their sins are exposed.\n"

For those who deplore sins of deed are to be admonished that perfected lamentations should wash out consummated evils, lest they be bound by a greater debt of perpetrated deed than they pay in tears of satisfaction for it. For it is written, “He has given us drink in tears by measure,” which means that each person’s soul should in its penitence drink the tears of compunction to such extent as it remembers itself to have been dried up from God through sins. They are to be admonished to bring back their past offenses incessantly before their eyes and so to live that these may not have to be viewed by the strict judge.Hence David, when he prayed, saying, “Turn away your eyes from my sins,” had said also a little before, “My fault is ever before me,” as if to say, I plead with you not to regard my sin, since I myself cease not to regard it. Thus also the Lord says through the prophet, “And I will not be mindful of your sins, but you should be mindful of them.” They are to be admonished to consider one at a time all their past offenses, and, in bewailing the defilements of their former wandering one by one, to cleanse at the same time their entire selves with tears. Thus it is well said through Jeremiah, when the several transgressions of Judah were being considered, “My eye has shed channels of waters. For indeed we shed channeled waters from our eyes, when to our several sins we give separate tears. For the mind does not sorrow at one and the same time alike for all things; but, while it is more sharply touched by memory now of this fault and now of that, being moved concerning all in each, it is purged at once from all.\n"

And: \"I am the burden of their songs\".

For, Psalm 28 (27):24 states: \"Requite them according, to their work, and according to the evil of their deeds.\"\n\nSecond, a determination of their penalty is evaluated. First, regards its duration: \"Thou wilt give them dullness of heart; thy curse will be on them.\" Namely, the sin by which they made you labor.\n\nBesides, Isaiah 1:14 claims: \"I am weary of bearing them.\" That is, since you (O Lord) restore a shield against their sins from their heart. So that, they are not to be penetrated by arrows of divine grace, and the sword of thy word (O Lord). Hence Job 41:15 can say: \"His back is made of rows of shields, shut up closely as with a seal.\"\n\nThird, the determination of penalty to their 'body is accounted for: \"Thou wilt pursue them in anger and destroy them from under thy heavens, O Lord.\" That is, through different afflictions.\"\n\nFinally, is considered up to the time you (O Lord) destroy them by death, and eternal damnation. That is\" under thy heaven O Lord. Namely, those persons who would desire to reside in these heavens.

In the first way the misery of the people is bewailed, in the second way the joy of those deriding is laid bare. As said in Verse 21: \"Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, dweller in the land of Uz; but to you also the cup shall pass; you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.\"\n\nAs to the misery of the people there are two further notions. First the affliction of the people themselves is bewailed, second their lack of power to resist. As said in Verse 17: \"Our eyes failed, ever watching vainly for help; in our watching we watched for a nation which could not save.\"\n\nThe first notion (the people's affliction bewailed) has two more ideas. in the first idea is bewailed the misery of people in general, and this idea is followed out twofold. As said in Verse 3: \"Even the jackals give the breast and suckle their young, but 'the daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.\"\n\nAs to the misery of people in general there are two ideas. First is expressed a metaphor, second, it is explained. As there in Verse 2: \"The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in fine gold, how they are reckoned as earthen pots, the work of a potter's hands!\" Since, there were eminent Jews in certain tribes with subtle knowledge of the divine. As Psalm (l47):20: \"He has not dwelt thus with any other nation; they do not know his ordinances. Praise the Lord!\" Thus is said in Verse 1: \"How the gold has grown dim, how the pure gold is changed!\" And as Proverbs: 20:15 says: \"There is gold, and abundance of costly stones; but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.\" Again: \"How the gold has grown dim\". Namely, by the shame of infidelity. As Isaiah 5:13 states: \"Therefore my people go into exile for want of knowledge.\"\n\nSecondly, 'some persons were eminent in the beauty of their honesty. As Sirach 44:6 states: \"rich men furnished with resources, living peaceably in their habitation\". Thus is said in Verse 1: \"how the pure gold is changed!\" That is, as if it is changed like to a blackness of sin, and sadness. As 2 Maccabees 3:16 says: \"for his face and the change in his color disclosed the anguish of his soul.\"\n\nThirdly, some persons were eminent in the cult of their religion. As Verse 1 concludes: \"The holy stones lie scattered at the head of every street.\" That is, the precious sons of different tribes, or nations. As I Maccabees: 4:43 states: \"And they cleansed the sanctuary and removed the defiled stones to an unclean place.\"\n"

And this indeed is what the Lord, in the wrath of just retribution, menaced through the prophet, saying, “And there shall be like people, like priest.” For the priest is as the people when one who bears a spiritual office acts as do others who are still under judgment with regard to their carnal pursuits. And this indeed the prophet Jeremiah, in the great sorrow of his charity, deplores under the image of the destruction of the temple, saying, “How is the gold become dim! The most excellent color is changed; the stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.” For what is expressed by gold, which surpasses all other metals, but the excellence of holiness? What by the most excellent color but the reverence that is about religion, to all people lovely? What are signified by the stones of the sanctuary but persons in sacred orders? What is figured under the name of streets but the latitude of this present life? For, because in Greek speech the word for latitude is platos, streets (plateoe) have been so called from their breadth, or latitude. But the Truth in person says, “Broad and spacious is the way that leads to destruction.” Gold, therefore, becomes dim when a life of holiness is polluted by earthly doings; the most excellent color is changed when the previous reputation of persons who were believed to be living religiously is diminished. For, when anyone after a habit of holiness mixes himself up with earthly doings, it is as though his color were changed, and the reverence that surrounded him grew pale and disregarded before the eyes of people. The stones of the sanctuary also are poured out into the streets, when those who, for the ornament of the church, should have been free to penetrate internal mysteries as it were in the secret places of the tabernacle seek out the broadways of secular causes outside. For indeed to this end they were made stones of the sanctuary that they might appear in the vestment of the high priest within the Holy of Holies. But when ministers of religion exact not the Redeemer’s honor from those that are under them by the merit of their life, they are not stones of the sanctuary in the ornament of the pontiff. And truly these stones of the sanctuary lie scattered through the streets when persons in sacred orders, given up to the latitude of their own pleasures, cleave to earthly businesses. And it is to be observed that they are said to be scattered, not in the streets but at the head of the streets; because, even when they are engaged in earthly matters, they desire to appear at the top so as to occupy the broad ways in their enjoyment of delight, and yet to be at the top of the streets in the dignity of holiness.\n"

Unclean! men cried at them; 'Away! Away! Touch not!'\"\n\nAs to the first view (affliction from their famine) there are four notions. First is indicated the famine among the youth, second, among the delicate and weak. As expressed in Verse 5: \"Those who feasted on dainties perish in the streets; those who were brought up in purple lie on ash heaps.\"\n\nThirdly is viewed the famine of those consecrated to the Lord God. As said in Verse 7: \"Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, the beauty of their form was like sapphire.\"\n\nFourthly, is viewed the immense famine among mothers, as expressed in Verse 10: \"The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children; they 'became their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.\"\n\nAs to the first, (famine among the youth) are two further ideas.

Death came through Eve, but life has come through Mary. And thus the gift of virginity has been bestowed most richly on women, seeing that it has had its beginning from a woman.

        "txt": "Here is exaggerated a punishment in comparison to the punishment of the Sodomites. As said in Verse 6: \"For the chastisement of the daughter of my people has been greater than the punishment of Sodom.\" And greater their fault was, due to their ingratitude, and the profanation of holy things. So, greater the punishment was, since the city is no longer. As the prophet Ezekiel says: \"And your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters.\" (Ezek: 16:46). And the Apostle Matthew reports: \"But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.\" (Matt: 11:24). And also Job 9:23: \"When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent.\"\n\nThe \"Gloss\" has: \"Morally this concerns the sin of simulation, because it is a sin far greater than the Sodomites.\" And the opposite is claimed in Chapter 3, Isaiah; (The Lord's Judgrnent). As said in Isaiah: 3:9: \"they proclaim their sin like Sodom, they do not hide it.\" Also, in the\"Gloss\" it says: \"A second plank to hide a sin, after a shipwreck.\"\n\nNow, as to this situation, it is claimed there is an alleviating condition to sin secretly. Indeed, a sin of simulation is the greater, since in this way deception and glory regarding others is sought out. So, such a situation is regarded the greater sin, not just simply, but even insofar as the effect of deception. Or, insofar as the matter a persons' sins: sins as to spiritualities. For such a person, who invents a falsehood, is much more blameable than one who counterfeits a coin. The philosopher (Aristotle) claims such.\n"

He was injured, but he threatened not; not when he was afflicted, not even when he was killed. But he grieved for those who dared to do such things. He, the Savior, suffered for humankind, but they despised and cast from them life and light and grace. All these were theirs through that Savior who suffered in our stead. And truly for their darkness and blindness, he wept. For if they had understood the things that are written in the psalms, they would not have been so vainly daring against the Savior, the Spirit having said, “Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?” And if they had considered the prophecy of Moses, they would not have hanged him who was their Life. And if they had examined with their understanding the things that were written, they would not have carefully fulfilled the prophecies that were against themselves, so as for their city to be now desolate, grace taken from them and they themselves without the law, being no longer called children but strangers. For thus in the Psalms was it before declared, saying, “The strange children have acted falsely by me.” And by Isaiah the prophet, “I have begotten and brought up children, and they have rejected me.” And they are no longer named the people of God and a holy nation, but rulers of Sodom and people of Gomorrah, having exceeded in this even the iniquity of the Sodomites, as the prophet also says, “Sodom is justified before you.” For the Sodomites raved against angels, but these against the Lord and God and King of all, and these dared to slay the Lord of angels, not knowing that Christ, who was killed by them, lives. But those Jews who had conspired against the Lord died, having rejoiced a very little in these temporal things and having fallen away from those which are eternal. They were ignorant of this—that the immortal promise has not respect to temporal enjoyment but to the hope of those things that are everlasting. For through many tribulations and labors and sorrows, the saint enters into the kingdom of heaven; but when he arrives where sorrow and distress and sighing shall flee away, he shall thenceforward enjoy rest; as Job, who, when tried here, was afterwards the familiar friend of the Lord. But the lover of pleasures, rejoicing for a little while, afterwards passes a sorrowful life like Esau, who had temporal food but afterwards was condemned by it.\n"

To Jerusalem, pierced and wounded with many sins, it is said, “Sodom is justified by you.” It is not because Sodom, which has sunk forever into ashes, is just in itself, that it is said by Ezekiel, “Sodom shall be restored to its former estate,” but that, in comparison with the more accursed Jerusalem, it appears just. For Jerusalem killed the Son of God; Sodom through fullness of bread and excessive luxury carried its lust beyond all bounds. The publican in the Gospel who struck his breast as though it were a collection of his worst thoughts and, conscious of his offenses, dared not lift up his eyes, is justified rather than the proud Pharisee. And Tamar in the guise of a harlot deceived Judah, and in the estimation of this man himself who was deceived, was worthy of the words, “Tamar is more righteous than I.” All this goes to prove that not only in comparison with divine majesty are people far from perfection, but also when compared with angels and other people who have climbed the heights of virtue. You may be superior to someone whom you have shown to be imperfect and yet be outstripped by another; and consequently you may not have true perfection, which, if it is perfect, is absolute.\n"

As said in Verse 8: \"Now their visage is blacker than soot, they are not recognised in the streets; their skin has shriveled upon their bones, it has become as dry as wood.\" Thirdly, a comparison is considered as to punishment, as next said in Verse 9: \"Happier were the victims of the sword than the victims of hunger, who pined away, stricken by want of the fruits of the field.\"\n\nAs to corporal beauty, a decent appearance is required, by which is a countenance of joyulness. As Verse 7 says: \"Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, the beauty of their form was like sapphire.\"\n\nAlso, an old dual color is required, namely,\"red\". As Verse 7 says: \"their bodies were more ruddy than coral.\" And also as \"white\". Again, as Verse 7 states: \"Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk\". Now, the philosopher (Aristotle) claims, the color \"white\" is exceedingly receptive to other colors. It is befitting that \"white\" be minus any stain. As Verse 7 refers to this idea: \"whiter than milk\".\n\nSo, such are extreme statements, howsoever false. For, they are figures of speech in which another idea is referred to, as sigiified. So literally such persons were adorned, due to cleanness, and abstinences of their life. As reported of the prophet Daniel, and his ssociates. Also as reported in Deuteronomy: 33:16: \"with the best gifts of the earth and its fulness, and the favor of him that dwelt in the bush. Let these come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brothers.\"\n"

For when you do not deny that the Creator’s Son and Spirit and Substance is also his Christ, you must allow that those who have not acknowledged the Father have failed likewise to acknowledge the Son through the identity of their natural substance; for if in Its fullness It has baffled human understanding, much more has a portion of It, especially when partaking of the fullness. Now, when these things are carefully considered, it becomes evident how the Jews rejected Christ and killed him; not because they regarded him as a strange Christ but because they did not acknowledge him, as though he were their own. For how could they have understood the strange One, concerning whom nothing had ever been announced, when they failed to understand him about whom there had been a perpetual course of prophecy? That admits of being understood or being not understood, which, by possessing a substantial basis for prophecy, will also have a subject matter for either knowledge or error; while that which lacks such matter admits not the issue of wisdom. So that it was not as if he belonged to another god that they conceived an aversion for Christ and persecuted him, but simply as a man whom they regarded as a wonder-working juggler and an enemy in his doctrines. They brought him therefore to trial as a mere man and one of themselves too—that is, a Jew (only a renegade and a destroyer of Judaism)—and punished him according to their law. If he had been a stranger, indeed, they would not have sat in judgment over him. So far are they from appearing to have understood him to be a strange Christ, that they did not even judge him to be a stranger to their own human nature.\n"

For consider all the things in the world that use this form or are associated with it. No one travels on the sea unless that trophy that is called a sail remains sound on the ship. No one ploughs the earth without it: diggers and mechanics cannot do their work unless they use tools that have this shape. And the human form differs from that of the irrational animals in nothing else than in its being erect and having the hands extended and having on the face extending from the forehead what is called the nose through which the living creature breathes. And this takes no other form than that of the cross. And so it was said by the prophet, “The breath before our face is the Lord Christ.” And the power of this form is further shown by your own symbols on what are called vexilla [banners] and trophies, with which all your state possessions are made, using these as the insignia of your power and government, even though you do so unwittingly. And with this form you consecrate the images of your emperors when they die, and you name them gods by inscriptions.\n"

For in the mystery of this assumption the nations live, who, imitating it through faith, come to salvation. David also, when saying, “Be mindful of my reproach, O Lord, with which they reproached me in exchange for your Christ,” seems to me to indicate the same. And what else does Paul mean when he says, “Your life is hidden with Christ in God,” and again in another passage, “Do you seek a proof of Christ, who speaks in me?” And now he says that Christ was hidden in God. The meaning of this expression, unless it is shown to be something such as we have pointed out above as intended by the prophet in the words “shadow of Christ,” exceeds, perhaps, the apprehension of the human mind. But we see also very many other statements in Holy Scripture respecting the meaning of the word shadow, as that well-known one in the Gospel according to Luke, where Gabriel says to Mary, “The Spirit of the Lord shall come on you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you.” And the apostle says with reference to the law that they who have circumcision in the flesh “serve for the similitude and shadow of heavenly things.” And elsewhere, “Is not our life on the earth a shadow?” If, then, not only the law that is on the earth is a shadow, but also all our life that is on the earth is the same, and we live among the nations under the shadow of Christ, we must see whether the truth of all these shadows may not come to be known in that revelation, when no longer through a glass and darkly, but face to face, all the saints shall deserve to behold the glory of God and the causes and truth of things. And the pledge of this truth being already received through the Holy Spirit, the apostle said, “Yes, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet from now on, we know him no more.”\n"

Now the Lord Jehovah, according to Moses, is faithful and true. He is true also in respect of his relation to shadow, type and image; for such is the Word who is in the opened heaven, for he is not on earth as he is in heaven; on earth he is made flesh and speaks through shadow, type and image. The multitude, therefore, of those who are reputed to believe are disciples of the shadow of the Word, not of the true Word of God who is in the opened heaven. Therefore Jeremiah says, “The Spirit of our face is Christ the Lord, of whom we said, In his shadow shall we live among the nations.” Thus the Word of God who is called faithful is also called true, and in righteousness he judges and makes war, since he has received from God the faculty of judging in very righteousness and very judgment and of apportioning its due to every existing creature. For none of those who have some portion of righteousness and of the faculty of judgment can receive on his soul such copies and impressions of righteousness and judgment as to come short in no point of absolute righteousness and absolute justice, just as no painter of a picture can communicate to the representation all the qualities of the original. This, I conceive, is the reason why David says, “Before you shall no living being be justified.” He does not say, no human, or no angel, but no living being, since even if any being partakes of life and has altogether put off mortality, not even then can it be justified in comparison with you who are, as it were, life itself. Nor is it possible that one who partakes of life and is therefore called living should become life itself, or that one who partakes of righteousness and, therefore, is called righteous should become equal to righteousness itself.Now it is the function of the Word of God, not only to judge in righteousness but also to make war in righteousness, that by making war on his enemies by reason and righteousness, so that what is irrational and wicked is destroyed, he may dwell in the soul of one who, for his salvation, so to speak, has become captive to Christ and may justify that soul and cast out from it all adversaries. We shall, however, obtain a better view of this war that the Word carries on if we remember that he is an ambassador for the truth, while there is another who pretends to be the Word and is not, and one who calls itself the truth and is not, but a lie. Then the Word, arming himself against the lie, slays it with the breath of his mouth and brings it to naught by the manifestation of his coming.\n"

He found out every way of knowledge and showed it to Jacob his son and Israel his beloved. Afterwards he was seen on earth and conversed with people.” And when they read them, they lament and bewail—as they themselves suppose—that desolation that happened through Nebuchadnezzar. However, as the truth shows, they unwillingly make a prelude to that lamentation that will overtake them. But after ten days from the ascension, which from the first Lord’s day is the fiftieth day, you are to keep a great festival, for on that day, at the third hour, the Lord Jesus sent on us the gift of the Holy Spirit, and we were filled with his energy, and we “spoke with new tongues, as that Spirit did suggest to us”; and we preached both to Jews and Gentiles that he is the Christ of God, who is “determined by him to be the judge of living and dead.” …Concerning him Jeremiah also did prophesy, saying, “The Spirit before his face, Christ the Lord, was taken in their snares, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the Gentiles.” Ezekiel also, and the following prophets, affirm everywhere that he is the Christ, the Lord, the King, the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Angel of the Father, the only-begotten God. He is the one therefore who we also preach to you and declare to be God the Word, who ministered to his God and Father for the creation of the universe. By believing in him, you shall live, but by disbelieving you shall be punished. For “he that is disobedient to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”\nTherefore, after you have kept the festival of Pentecost, keep one week more festival, and after that fast; for it is reasonable to rejoice for the gift of God and to fast after that relaxation.… Therefore fast, and ask your petitions of God. We enjoin you to fast every fourth day of the week and every day of the preparation, and whatever you have left over because of your fast bestow on the needy. Every sabbath day excepting one, and every Lord’s day, hold your solemn assemblies, and rejoice, for he will be guilty of sin who fasts on the Lord’s day, being the day of the resurrection, or during the time of Pentecost, or, in general, who is sad on a festival day to the Lord.

As expressed in Verse 19: \"But thou, O Lord, dost reign for ever; thy throne endures to all generations.\"\n\nThe first idea (the people's misery) has two aspects. First, the people's misery, in itself is exposed, second, the people's goods that were lost. As said in Verse 14: \"The old men have quit the city gate, the young men their music.\"\n\nAround the first (misery in itself) are two notations. First, in Verse 1 is aroused attention: \"Remember, O Lord, what has befallen us;\". That is, be attentive to our misery itself. And, as said in Chapter 3:19: \"Remember my affliction and my bitterness, the wormwood and the gall!\"\n\nSo, Verse 1 says: \"Remember, O Lord, what has befallen us.\"Which states, as if, hold in attention. Then: \"behold\": with such attention fix your consideration,\"and see our disgrace!\"\n"
