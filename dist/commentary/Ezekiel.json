And in his thirtieth year of age, and in the fifth year of the captivity, he began to speak to his fellow captives. And at the same time, though later, this one in Chaldea and Jeremiah in Judea prophesied. His style is neither greatly eloquent nor excessively rustic, but properly proportioned between both. And he was a priest, as also was Jeremiah, the beginning and ending of the book being wrapped in great obscurities. But also the common edition of him does not differ much from the Hebrew one. Because of that I greatly wonder what was the cause, that when we have the same translators in all the books, in some they translated the same things, in others, different things. Therefore, read this also according to our translation because, by being written in words with spaces, it gives a clearer meaning to readers. And if my friends also mock this, say to them that no one restrains them from writing.

        "txt": "[Daniel 7:9] \"I beheld until thrones were set up, and the Ancient of days took His seat. His garment was as white as snow, and the hair of His head was like pure wool. His throne was composed of fiery flames and its wheels were set on fire. From before His presence there issued forth a rushing, fiery stream.\" We read something similar in John's Apocalypse: \"After these things I was immediately in the Spirit, and lo, a throne was set up in heaven, and one was seated upon the throne; and He who sat upon it had the likeness of jasper and sardine stone, and there was a rainbow round about the throne like the appearance of emerald. Around the throne there were twenty-four other thrones, and upon the twenty-four thrones there sat twenty-four elders, clothed in shining garments; upon their heads was a golden crown, and lightning flashes issued from the throne, and voices and thunder. And in front of the throne there were seven torches of burning fire, which were the seven spirits of God. And in front of the throne lay a glassy sea like unto crystal.\" (Revelation 4:2-6) And so the many thrones which Daniel saw seem to me to be what John called the twenty-four thrones. And the Ancient of days is the One who, according to John sits alone upon His throne. Likewise the Son of man, who came unto the Ancient of days, is the same as He who, according to John, is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, and the titles of that sort (Revelation 5:5). I imagine that these thrones are the ones of which the Apostle Paul says, \"Whether thrones or dominions...\" (Colossians 1:16). And in the Gospel we read, \"Ye yourselves shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel\" (Matthew 19:28). And God is called the One who sits and who is the Ancient of days, in order that His character as eternal Judge might be indicated. His garment is shining white like the snow, and the hair of His head is like pure wool. The Savior also, when He was transfigured on the mount and assumed the glory of His divine majesty, appeared in shining white garments (Matthew 17:2). And as for the fact that His hair is compared to perfectly pure wool, the even-handedness and uprightness of His judgment is shown forth, a judgment which shows no partiality in its exercise. Moreover He is described as an elderly man, in order that the ripeness of His judgment may be established. His throne consists of fiery flames, in order that sinners may tremble before the severity of the torments, and also that the just may be saved, but so as by fire. The wheels of the throne are set aflame, or else it is the wheels of His chariot which are aflame. In Ezekiel also God is ushered on the scene seated in a four-horse chariot (Ezekiel 1:4-28), and everything pertaining to God is of a fiery consistency. In another place also a statement is made on this subject: \"God is a consuming fire\" (Deuteronomy 4:24), that we might know that wood, hay and stubble are going to burn up in the day of judgment. And in the Psalms we read: \"Fire goeth before Him, and He shall set aflame all His enemies round about Him\" (Psalm 97:3). A rushing, fiery stream proceeded from before Him in order that it might carry sinners to hell (Gehenna).\n"

But because all the elect are members of our Savior, for our Savior is indeed the head of all the elect, in that his members are thereby depicted, there is no obstacle to even him being signified in all these. For the only-begotten Son of God truly became man; he deigned to die like an ox at sacrifice for our salvation; he, through the virtue of his fortitude, rose as a lion. Moreover, the lion is said to sleep with open eyes because, in the very death in which our Savior could sleep through his humanity, by remaining immortal in his divinity, he kept vigil. Furthermore, ascending to heaven after his resurrection, he was carried aloft to the heights like an eagle. He is therefore wholly the same within us at the same time, who became a man by being born, an ox in dying, a lion in rising again and an eagle in ascending to the heavens.\n"

Nor is it without wondrous reason that those two are said to be on the right and that one on the left. And, again, we must ask why the eagle is said to be not on the right or the left but above these four. Thus we present two questions that we must answer with the Lord’s revelation. Indeed, a man and a lion are said to be on the right and an ox on the left. So, we have joys on the right and sorrows on the left. Hence we describe as our left that which we consider to be adverse. And, as we said before, the incarnation is represented by the man, the passion by the ox and truly the resurrection of our Creator by the lion. For all the elect were gladdened by the incarnation of the only-begotten Son, through whom we are saved; truly the holy apostles, the first of the elect, were saddened by his death and rejoiced anew at his resurrection. Because, therefore, his nativity and his resurrection offer joy to his disciples, who were saddened by his passion, the man and the lion are described as being on the right and truly the ox on the left. For, indeed, these same holy Evangelists rejoiced in his humanity and were encouraged by his resurrection, they who had been saddened by his passion. Therefore, the man and the lion are on the right because the incarnation of our Savior gave them life, the resurrection established them. But the ox is to the left, because his death laid them low for a moment in faithlessness. But the place of the eagle is rightly defined not beside but above them, since, whether because it denotes his ascension or because it declares the Word of the Father to be with the Father, in the virtue of contemplation he surpasses the Evangelists; for, although speaking with them about Christ’s divinity, he contemplates this more subtly than all of them. But if, when the eagle is joined with the other three, they are said to be four living creatures, is it any wonder that he is described as above these, because having seen the Word in the beginning, John even transcended himself?\n"

Temperance, when it contemplates the heavenly mysteries and is retrained by consecrated chastity, cares nothing for bodily pleasures. And justice, from a certain high position of revelation, sees and searches out anything produced for others rather than itself; justice does not examine its own conveniences as much as what benefits society. It is appropriate that the soul that has acted with justice is symbolized by an eagle. It should fly away from earthly things and be totally intent on the divine mystery of the sublime resurrection.

Now the Gospels, in which Christ is enthroned, are like these. John expounds his princely and mighty and glorious birth from the Father, saying, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,” and “All things were made by him, and without him was nothing made.” Therefore this Gospel is deserving of all confidence, for such indeed is his person. That according to Luke has a priestly character, and it began with the priest Zechariah offering incense to God. For the fatted calf was already being prepared that was to be sacrificed for the finding of the younger son. Matthew proclaims his human birth, saying, “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham,” and “The birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner.” This Gospel is manlike, and so through the whole Gospel Christ appears as a man of humble mind and gentle. But Mark takes his beginning from the prophetic Spirit who comes on people from on high, saying, “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet,” showing a winged image of the Gospel. Therefore he made his message concise and immediate, for such is the prophetic character.\n"

        "txt": "This is also how Ezekiel depicts those animals that praise God. In the four figures of the four Evangelists he demonstrates the glory of the Father and draws attention to his workings, in whom all four points of the compass are fulfilled. “The one animal,” he says, “had four figures”; because each figure is a Gospel, it appears in a fourfold fashion. The first figure, he says, which was like an ox, indicates the priestly glory of Jesus, which Luke depicts. The second, which was like a lion, indicates the leadership and regal nature of the lion “of the tribe of Judah”; this is what Matthew depicts. The third was like a human being and shows the Son’s capacity for suffering and the lowly nature of humanity; this is what Mark shows. However, the fourth, the eagle, teaches the spiritual secret of his power and might who flies up to the Father’s heaven; this is John’s message.\n"

For as the eagle rules over all the other birds and the lion is king of the wild beasts and the bull over the tamed animals and humanity rules over all creatures, so the soul has certain dominant powers that are superior to others. I am speaking of the faculties of the will: conscience, the mind and the power of loving. For it is through such that the chariot of the soul is directed, and it is in these that God resides. In some other fashion also such a symbolism can be applied to the heavenly church of the saints. In this text of Ezekiel’s vision it is said that the animals were exceedingly tall, full of eyes. It was impossible for anyone to comprehend the number of eyes or grasp their height since the knowledge of such was not given. And in a similar manner the stars in the sky are given for people to gaze on and be filled with awe, but to know their number is given to no one. So in regard to the saints in the heavenly church it is permitted to all who only enter into it and enjoy it as they strive to live in it. But to know and comprehend the number of the saints is given only to God.\n"

For they say, “how severely and bitterly the bishop has preached!” not knowing that for bishops speaking is more a matter of obligation than of desire. Speaking, I say, is more a matter of obligation—not because the desire to preach the truth is lacking but because the silence that comes from not speaking is driven away by the punishment of the law.… This, then, is the preacher’s situation—that he should not be silent with respect to the sins of another if he wishes to avoid sinning himself, and that he should correct his brother by reproving him so that he may not destroy what is priestly in himself.… Consequently it is better to correct the sinner by rebuking him than to accept the sinner’s misdeed by keeping quiet. This is the position in which we have been placed: if we told sinners that their crimes were not their own, the guilt of their crimes would also implicate us. For this is in fact what the Lord says through the prophet: “And you, son of man, I have given you as a watchman to the house of Israel, and you shall hear the word from my mouth. When I say to the sinner, ‘You shall die the death, and you do not speak so that the impious may beware of his way, the wicked himself shall die in his own wickedness, but I will require his blood from your hand,’ ” and so forth. Clearly these words are plain and obvious. They soil the watchmen with criminal blood when he keeps silence, and they are not satisfied that the evildoers’ own evil doing condemns him unless they also incriminate the one who was unwilling to rebuke the evil in question. So, then, how great the iniquity of the sinner is! The sinner sins, and the bishop is convicted; he kills himself by his own sins, and his blood is required from the hand of the bishop.… What is a watchman? A watchman is one who, while standing (as it were) on a lofty pinnacle, looks out on the people around him so that no enemy falls unexpectedly on them but so that, as he keeps careful watch, the populace live in harmony and peace.\n"

See Origen (Calmet) \nThe Alexandrian copy has the former, (Haydock) the Roman edition the latter number; and is followed by Theodoret and Maldon at. (Calmet) \nBut the more accurate Septuagint agree with the Hebrew The captivity of Israel must be dated from Phacee, (4 Kings xv. 29.) to the end of the reign of Darius Memnon, who espoused Esther, and granted liberty \"to all the Jews \"or rather from Mana them, (4 Kings xv. 19.) to the 28th of the same king Assuerus. Thus God's \"grace, we think, and we may so speak without arrogance, has enabled us to explain this difficulty, which no other has done. \"(St. Jerome) \nMany confound the duration of the iniquity of Israel with that of Juda, forming 430 years; and they explain it of the time during which the nation had prevaricated. But this seems unnatural. We may rather conclude, that the prophet speaks of a separate judgment, and dates from the destruction of Samaria and of Jerusalem. The former city was taken the year of the world 3283. If we add 390 years, we shall find the year 3673 the very year when Alexander overcame Darius, and soon after granted the Jews full liberty to return, or live according to their own laws. This he granted to those in Babylon, and to the Israelites (Calmet) in Media. Josephus, Antiquities xi. ultra contra Apion i. \nPhiladelphus afterwards liberated many in Egypt, (Josephus, Antiquities xii. 2.) as Osee (xi. 11.) had foretold. The chastisement of Juda must be dated from the destruction of Jerusalem under Sedecias, till Darius, the Mede, favoured the Jews about forty years afterwards. (Calmet) \nSt. Jerome only allows forty years to have elapsed from the first of Jechonias till the first of Cyrus. The want of an exact chronology gives rise to many such difficulties. (Haydock) \nIt is very hard to explain how the ten tribes were 390 and the two tribes 40 years in captivity, as it is certain that the latter were seventy year banished from their own country. (Worthington) \nPerhaps during the last thirty their condition was greatly ameliorated, after the decree of Cyrus, though the liberation was only perfect under Hystaspes and Esther. (Haydock) \nThe iniquity of Israel, from Solomon to Salmanasar, lasted 390 years; and that of Juda, under the reign of Manasses, was most abominable for the space of forty years; (Tournemine) or it continued so long from the 18th of Josias till the 4th, after the city was destroyed, and the land became a desert. (Usher, the year of the world 3380 to 3420.) \nBut how shall the reign of the virtuous Josias be included in this period? (Haydock) \nThe action of the prophet lying 430 days, denoted the length of the siege of Jerusalem, during which extreme scarcity should be felt, and also the captivity of the people. Some have thought that he could not remain 390 days on one side, and that all passed in spirit. But what impression would that make upon the people? He was chained down, (Calmet) to represent their miserable condition. (Haydock) \nPrædo saw a fool who lay tied in one posture for above fifteen years. (Calmet) \nThe remaining so long in one posture must have been painful to the prophet. (Tirinus) Ver. 7. Siege, which shall be most terrible; (Haydock) 390 days: the pillage shall last other forty. (Tirinus) \nSo many years have the people transgressed. \nOut. Hebrew, \"naked. \"Thus various barbarians fight. \nProphesy, not by words, (chap. viii. 26.) but by actions. (Menochius)\n"

But the other books went at least under the same title; and there must be some mistake in the words asterisked, since they occur in the Hebrew, Vulgate, third being only substituted for fourth: \"And a fourth part of thee shall fall by the sword. \"The Hebrew is rather less degrading to the Jews, as there would be thus at most one-third preserved, instead of a part only of one-fourth. See Deuteronomy xxvii. 4., and Jeremias lii. 28. \nTake. Septuagint add here, \"a fourth part; and shalt burn it in the midst of it; and a fourth thou shalt cut \"(Haydock) \nHe was thus to deal with a part of the hair during 390 days, (Menochius) or at the end of them. (R. Salom.) \nRound, in the cities near Jerusalem, (Worthington) or round the picture of it, chap. iv. 1.\n"

Thau, or Tau, is the last letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and signifies a sign or a mark: which is the reason why some translators render this place set a mark, or mark a mark, without specifying what this mark was. But St. Jerome, and other interpreters, conclude it was the form of the letter thau, which, in the ancient Hebrew character, was the form of a cross. (Challoner) \nOf this many inscriptions still extant bear witness. (Montfaucon.) \nSome Rabbins allow that the last letter was used but in honour of \"the law \"Thorah. The cross is supposed to be the hieroglyphic of a future life, (Hist. Rufini. ii. 29.) and found frequently in the pictures or (Haydock) in the tables of Isis. But it rather represents a key. Soldiers who were acquitted received the letter T, and those who were sentenced to die had Th, (Calmet) alluding to Thanatos, \"death. \"(Haydock) \nWe may, however, suppose that if God designated any letter, it would be some letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and accordingly the last had formerly the figure of Cross. x. though this text may signify \"a sign \"in general. The virtuous would be discriminated from the guilty, as if they were marked. (Calmet) \nThe door-posts of the Hebrews were stained with blood, in Egypt, to show that all should be redeemed by that of Christ; and here those who shall be saved, received the mark of his cross. This sign has always been held in veneration among Christians, (Worthington) and used in conferring baptism, consecrating the blessed Eucharist (St. Chrysostom, hom. lv. in Matthew, and lxxxiv. in John) (St. Augustine, tr. cxviii. in John, and ser. ci. de temp.) \nIt appeared to Constantine with this inscription, \"In this conquer \"(Eusebius, vit. i. 22.) and again over Jerusalem; (St. Cyril, ep. ad Constantium.) and will be borne before Christ, at his last coming, (Matthew xxiv.) to the joy of those who have performed their baptismal promises, and to the confusion (Worthington) of the enemies of the cross of Christ.

It makes a great deal of difference, you see, where a person keeps the sign of Christ, whether on the forehead or both on the forehead and in the heart. You heard, when the holy prophet Ezekiel was speaking, how before God sent an exterminator of a wicked people, he first sent a marker and said to him, “Go and mark with a sign the foreheads of those who groan and grieve over the sins of my people, which are committed among them.” Yet for all that they groan and grieve; and this is why they have been marked with a sign on the forehead—the forehead of the inner self, not the outer one. There is a forehead of the face, you see, and a forehead of the conscience. In fact, sometimes the inner forehead gets a knock, and the outer one blushes; it either blushes for shame or turns pale with fright.\n"

I have not recovered my money, and I have injured myself.” But if you have grieved on account of sin, you have blotted it out and reaped the greatest pleasure. If you have grieved for your brothers who have fallen, you have both encouraged and comforted yourself and have also restored them; and even if you were not to profit them, you have an abundant recompense. And that you may learn that grieving for those who have fallen, though we should not at all benefit them, still brings us a large reward, hear what Ezekiel says, or rather, what God speaks through him. For when he had sent certain messengers to overturn the city and to consume all the dwellings with sword and fire, along with their inhabitants, God charges one of them, “Set a mark on the forehead of those that groan and are in anguish.” And after charging the others and saying, “Begin from my holy ones,” he goes on to add, “but do not touch whoever has the sign on him.”\n"

For the living creatures of heaven are described as full of eyes round about and within. So it is fitting that those who are over others should have eyes within and round about, so that in striving to please the inward judge and in serving outwardly as examples of life, they may detect the things that should be corrected in others. Subjects are to be warned not to judge rashly the lives of their superiors, if perchance they see them act blamably in anything; otherwise, when they rightly find fault with evil, they are plunged to lower depths by the impulse of elation. They are to be warned that, when they consider the faults of their superiors, they grow not too bold against them. On the contrary, even if any of their superiors’ deeds are exceedingly bad, the subjects’ private judgment, constrained by the fear of God, should still not lead them to refuse to bear the yoke of reverence under them.\n"

One will say, “If they are justly punished, we ought not to grieve.” What we ought to grieve for is this, that they were found worthy of punishment.

You do not say to yourself, “What is this?” This cutting is for health, to speed his recovery; it is for his deliverance, this burning?

When the blessed Antony was summoned by Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, to the city of Alexandria to confute heretics, and Didymus, a most learned and blessed man, had a meeting with him, they had a discussion about the holy Scriptures. Antony admired the other’s brain and praised his mental sharpness. Then he asked, “I imagine that your blindness does not depress you?” Didymus in his shame said nothing. But when Antony asked a second and third time, he finally succeeded in eliciting from Didymus a simple expression of grief. Antony said to him, “I am surprised at a wise man grieving at the loss of what ants, flies and gnats have rather than rejoicing at having what only the saints and apostles have deserved to get.” From this you can realize that it is much better to see with the spirit than with the flesh and to possess the eyes that the mote of sin cannot enter.\n"

For this present section and that which follows it are recorded to have taken place in the first and third years of the reign of King Belshazzar (Jeremiah 39) [Jerome's citation of Jeremiah 39 seems quite pointless in this connection]. But the section which we read previously to the one just preceding this, is recorded to have taken place in the last year, indeed on the final day, of Belshaz-zar's reign. And we meet this phenomenon not only in Daniel but also in Jeremiah [cf. Jeremiah 35 and Jeremiah 34] and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 17), as we shall be able to show, if life spares us that long. But in the earlier portion of the book, the historical order has been followed, namely the events which occurred in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, and Belshazzar, and Darius or Cyrus. But in the passages now before us an account is given of various visions which were beheld on particular occasions and of which only the prophet himself was aware, and which therefore lacked any importance as signs or revelations so far as the barbarian nations were concerned. But they were written down only that a record of the things beheld might be preserved for posterity.\n"

One is the death due to sin, concerning which it was written, the soul that sins shall itself die.” Another death is the mystical, when someone dies to sin and lives to God; concerning this the apostle likewise says, or we were buried with him by means of baptism into death. The third is the death by which we complete our lifespan with its functions—I mean the separation of the soul and body. Thus we perceive that the one death is an evil, if we die on account of sins, but the other, in which the deceased has been justified of sin, is a good, while the third stands in between, for it seems good to the just and fearful to most people; although it gives release to all, it gives pleasure to few.\n"

I will listen to you, as to a holy people. [2 Chronicles 7:14] And in another place He speaks thus: \"Wash you and become clean; put away the wickedness of your souls from before my eyes; cease from your evil ways, and learn to do well; seek out judgment, deliver the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and see that justice is done to the widow; and come, and let us reason together. He declares, Though your sins be like crimson, I will make them white as snow; though they be like scarlet, I will whiten them like wool. And if you be willing and obey me, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you refuse, and will not hearken unto me, the sword shall devour you, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.\" [Isaiah 1:16-20] Desiring, therefore, that all His beloved should be partakers of repentance, He has, by His almighty will, established [these declarations].\n"

(Worthington) \nWe know not what the ancients wanted to know; but their design was evil. (Calmet) Ver. 4. Judgest them; or, if thou wilt enter into the cause, and plead against them. (Challoner) \nLay before them the iniquities of their fathers, and their own, which bring on the reprobation of the greatest part. God will form his Church out of a few of them and of the Gentiles. The return of a small number from captivity is also insinuated. Ver. 6. Excelleth. Hebrew, \"is beauty or a desire. \"Septuagint, \"a honeycomb. \"(Calmet) Ver. 7. Scandals, (offensiones) that is, the abominations or idols, to the worship of which they were allured by their eyes. (Challoner) \nMoses found them in this condition in Egypt, and he could not entirely reclaim them. (Calmet) \nMany still secreted their idols, chap. xxiii. 1., and Acts vii. 42. (Haydock) Ver. 8. Egypt. Their disorders called for such severity. But God was restrained by the dangers (Calmet) of blasphemy, to which the faithful and idolaters would thus have been exposed. (Haydock) \nHe saved them as he had promised, though they did not deserve it. (Worthington) Ver. 10. Brought. Literally, \"cast \"(Haydock) as if they had been reluctant. Ver. 11. Live, and enjoy temporal felicity, which was chiefly promised, though the faithful observers of the law would obtain an eternal reward. Ver. 12. Sign, as also to promote piety and instruction. Ver. 13. Sabbaths. We only read of one man gathering sticks, and the people manna once on those days, Exodus xv., and xvi. But Moses does not mention all. (Calmet) \nSabbath often denotes the whole law, which they transgressed; and as long as they retained an affection for idols, they could not observe the sabbaths so as to please God. Ver. 14. But. Literally, \"And I did for \"This motive caused me to spare them. (Haydock) \nI punished only the most guilty adorers of the calf, and murmurers, Numbers xiv. 28. (Calmet) \nSome were always preserved for a succession, ver. 9, 22. (Worthington) Ver. 23. Again, or also. (Haydock) \nFour times are specified ver. 13, 15, 21., which may allude to the adoration of the calf, the graves of concupiscence, the murmuring, and commerce with the women and idols of Moab, Exodus xxiii., and Numbers x., and xiv., and xxv. (Calmet) Ver. 25. Not good. The laws and ordinances of their enemies: or those imposed upon them by that cruel tyrant the devil, to whose power they were delivered up for their sins; (Challoner) which may be styled the statutes of your fathers, ver. 18. (Haydock) \nGod is often said to do what he only permits. (Calmet) \nHe abandoned them to their own perversity. (St. Jerome) (Deuteronomy xxxii. 21, 37.) \nIf God had spoken of the Decalogue, would he say such laws were not good, after he had testified that the observers shall live in them? ver. 11. He established the ceremonial law, at the same time. See Kimchi; Menochius Chaldean, \"I have given them up to their foolish desires. They have established bad statutes and laws which will not give them life. \"This seems the best explanation. (Calmet) \nHebrew, \"Have I given.(26) and have I polluted them? \"(Manasse Ben. Israel.) The precepts had also a bad effect, and were given in condescension to the weakness of the people, (Origen) particularly the ceremonial part. (St. Just.; St. Chrysostom; St. Jerome) \nThey did not justify, (St. Augustine) and were not good, compared with those of the new law. (St. Gregory, mor. xxviii. 9.) \nThus Solon gave the Athenians \"the best laws that they would receive \"(Plutarch) though others more perfect might have been devised. (Calmet) Ver. 26. I polluted them That is, I gave them up to such blindness, in punishment of their offences, as to pollute themselves with the blood of all their first-born, whom they offered up to their idols in compliance with their wicked devices. (Challoner) (Menochius) (Leviticus xviii. 21., and 4 Kings iii. ultra, and xxi. 6. (Calmet) \nOffered. Protestants, \"caused to pass through the fire all, chap. xvi. 21. \nFor their. Protestants, \"that I might make them desolate to the end, that \"Ver. 29. Called high. Hebrew, \"Bamah \"(Haydock) out of contempt. (Calmet) \nThe Jews were so much attached to the high places, that they called the altar of the Lord by the same name. Thus heretics are convicted by the very names they use, calling sacrifice service (Worthington) Ver. 32. Stones. This was the secret intention of the ancients, (\n"

For “the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.” But their snares became known, and the plots that they had contrived against the Son of God were understood when they “crucified the Lord of glory.” Therefore the apostle says, “We speak a wisdom among the perfect; yet a wisdom not of this world or of the rulers of this world, which are coming to naught … a wisdom that none of the rulers of this world knew.

Not unworthily did he become an object of admiration to all, when—and all people do admire this—though enjoying royal friendships, he looked not for gold or counted the honor given him as more precious than his faith.

        "txt": "We now find in the prophet Ezekiel two prophecies addressed to the prince of Tyre, the first of which might appear, before one had heard the second, to be spoken of some man who was prince of the Tyrians. For the present, therefore, we shall take nothing from the first one. But since the second is most evidently of such a kind that it cannot possibly refer to a man but must be understood of some higher power that fell from higher places and was cast down to lower and worse ones, we shall conclude that as an illustration that most clearly proves that these opposing and wicked powers were not so formed and created by nature but came from better conditions and changed for the worse; and [we shall conclude] that the blessed powers also are not of such a nature as to be unable to admit qualities the opposite of their own, supposing one of them should desire to do so and should become negligent and fail to guard with the utmost caution the blessedness of his condition. For when he who is called “prince of Tyre” is said to have been “among the holy ones” and “without stain” and set “in the paradise of God,” “adorned with a crown of honor and beauty,” how, I ask, can we suppose such a being to have been inferior to any of the holy ones? He is described as having been “a crown of honor and beauty” and as having walked “in the paradise of God” “without stain.” How then can anyone possibly suppose that such a being was not one of those holy and blessed powers that, dwelling as they do in a state of blessedness, we must believe are endowed with no other honor than this?… Who is there that, hearing such sayings as this, “You were a signet of likeness and a crown of honor in the delights of the paradise of God,” or this, “from the time you were created with the cherubim, I placed you on the holy mount of God,” could possibly weaken their meaning to such an extent as to suppose them spoken of a human being, even of a saint, not to mention the prince of Tyre? Or what “fiery stones” can he think of, “in the midst” of which any person could have lived? Or who could be regarded as “stainless” from the very day he was created and yet at some later time could have acts of unrighteousness found in him and be said to be “cast forth into the earth”? This certainly indicates that the prophecy is spoken of one who, not being on the earth, was “cast forth into the earth,” whose holy places also are said to be polluted. These statements, therefore, from the prophet Ezekiel concerning the prince of Tyre must relate, as we have shown, to an adverse power, and they prove in the clearest manner that this power was originally holy and blessed, and that he fell from this state of blessedness and was cast down into the earth “from the time that iniquity was found in him” and that his fallen condition was not due to his nature or creation. We consider, therefore, that these statements refer to some angel, to whom had been allotted the duty of supervising the Tyrian people, whose souls also were apparently committed to his care. But what Tyre, or what souls of Tyrians we ought to understand—whether it is the city that is situated in the territory of the province of Phoenicia or some other city of which the one we know on earth is a figure, and whether the souls are those of the actual Tyrians or of the inhabitants of that Tyre that we understand spiritually—there seems no need to inquire here. For we should appear to be investigating, in a casual manner matters whose importance and obscurity certainly demand a work and treatment of their own.\n"

The prophet immediately adds, every precious stone was your covering, carnelian, topaz and jasper, chrysolite, onyx and beryl, sapphire, carbuncle and emerald. He gave the names of nine stones, since there are nine ranks of angels. The first angel was adorned and covered with these nine since when it was set ahead of the whole multitude of angels, it was more illustrious in comparison with them. Why have I briefly listed these choirs of steadfast angels, if I am not also to comment more specifically on their functions? In Greek, angels are “messengers,” and archangels are the most important messengers. We should know too that the word angel is the name of a service, not of a nature. The holy spirits of our heavenly homeland are always indeed spirits, but they cannot always be called angels since they are only angels when some message is communicated by them. So the psalmist says, he makes his spirits angels, as if to say plainly, he who always possesses them as spirits makes them angels when he wishes. Those that communicate relatively unimportant messages are called angels and those that communicate the most important are called archangels. That is why it was not just any angel, but the archangel Gabriel, that was sent to the Virgin Mary. It was right that a most important angel should come on this mission, to communicate the most important message of all.\n"

Those who are not in a position to address a large assembly should instruct individuals, offering instruction in personal talks; they should try to serve those around them through simple encouragement.… You who are pastors, consider that you are pasturing God’s flock. We often see a block of salt put out for animals to lick for their well-being. Priests among their people should be like blocks of salt. They should counsel everyone in their flocks in such a way that all those with whom they come in contact may be seasoned with eternal life as if they had been sprinkled with salt. We who preach are not the salt of the earth unless we season the hearts of those who listen to us. We are really preaching to others if we ourselves do what we say, if we are pierced with God’s love, if, since we cannot avoid sin, our tears wash away the stains on our life that come with each new day. We truly feel remorse when we take to heart the lives of our forebears in the faith so that we are diminished in our own eyes. Then do we truly feel remorse, when we attentively examine God’s teachings and adopt for our own use what those we revere themselves used for theirs. And while we are moved to remorse on our own account, let us also take responsibility for the lives of those entrusted to our care. Our own bitter compunction should not divert us from concern for our neighbor. What good to love and strive to do good for our neighbor and abandon ourselves? We must realize that our passion for justice in the face of another’s evil must never cause us to lose the virtue of gentleness. Priests must not be quick-tempered or rash; they must instead be temperate and thoughtful. We must support those we challenge and challenge those we support. If we neglect this, our work will lack either courage or gentleness. What shall we call the human soul but the food of the Lord? It is created to become nothing less than Christ’s body and to bring about growth in the eternal church. We priests are to season this food. Cease to pray, cease to teach, and the salt loses its taste.\n"

At the very words of the prophet, as we read, the crop of human bodies seems to rise up again to life, and one may see the wide expanses of the fields sprouting with a novel kind of growth.\n"

A soldier who expects his share of the spoils is ready for war. But no one is prepared to die serving a king so undiscerning that he does not provide rewards for labors. In the same way, any soul that believes in resurrection takes care for itself, as is right, but any soul that disbelieves the resurrection abandons itself to destruction. A person who believes that the body survives to rise again is careful of this garment and does not soil it by fornicating. But a person who does not believe in the resurrection gives himself up to fornication, abusing his own body as if it were nothing to him. A mighty message and teaching of the holy Catholic church is belief about the resurrection of the dead; mighty and most indispensable. While many deny it, the truth claims credence for it. Greeks deny it, Samaritans disbelieve, while heretics tear away the half. Truth never appears but in one shape, while contradiction assumes a hundred.\n"

But thus the temple would be four miles round, and the city thirty-six, which never was the case. II. Hence more modern Jews assert it will be fulfilled by the Messias. III. Rejecting these errors, Lyranus, suppose that the promise was conditional, and that the sins of the Jews prevented the city and temple from being so large; and that the mystical temple of the Church is also insinuated, into which both Jews and Gentiles shall enter. IV. Though this opinion be probable, it seems better to follow St. Jerome, St. Gregory, who cannot apply all to the Old Testament, nor think that such a huge temple and city were indeed promised, but explain some parts of the captives at their return, as a figure of those redeemed by Christ, and brought into his Church, which is adorned with all graces. Yet the greatest part must be understood of the Church triumphant. (Worthington) \nSt. Jerome confesses his ignorance of this subject; and those who have come after him, though they imitate not his modesty, add little to dissipate the mist with which this vision is surrounded. Some have adhered too close to Josephus, while Villalpand has here discovered all the magnificence of Greek and Roman architecture, and has represented the temple six times as large as it really was. It seems that the prophet has described the same temple of Solomon which he had seen, that the dimensions might be preserved, and the hopes of the people kept up; (Calmet) and that they might comprehend what a loss they actually sustained on account of their sins, (Haydock) and might strive to come up to this pattern (Du Hamel) as \"near as they should be able \"the wealth of the people being much less than Solomon's. (Grotius) \nThese arguments do not, however, show that the buildings were to resemble each other. They vary in many particulars; and the prophet would specify what was to be really executed. He says nothing of the ornamental part, and little of the height, which are the most expensive. (Houbigant) (Preface) \nIf some things appear to be too grand for the temple of Solomon, and of Zorobabel, we must reflect that the prophet passes from the figure to the Church of Christ, which is not unusual. (Menochius) \nAlcasar and Bossuet explain it wholly of the Church, so that the letter requires few notes. (Du Hamel)\n"

And what is the flock to do about necessities if their shepherd refuses to hear and ponder what this present time requires? Therefore a priest who goes out before the people puts on thicker garments in order to compose the habit of his mind for the benefit of his children, even to bear earthly cares. Think, I ask you, dearest brothers, how much toil there is for the watchman, both to extend his heart to the sublime and suddenly to recall it to the depths, and to refine the spirit in the heights of inward understanding and because of the exterior causes of his neighbors, so to speak, suddenly thicken in contemplation.\n"

If they had returned all together, they might probably have put it in execution.

Dan, 2. Aser, 3. Nephthali, 4. Manasses, 5. Ephraim, 6. Ruben, and 7.

Issachar, 12. Zabulon, and 13. Gad, had each about half the quantity of the others, though the tribes occupied the whole extent from east to west, their lots being marked out by parallel lines. Between Juda and Benjamin, a square of 500 cubits was assigned for the temple; another square of 4,500, or 18,000 in circuit, lay round the former for the city of the Levites: round this were suburbs 250 cubits broad, walled about, and having three gates on each side. Next them dwelt their lay servants, in a space 5,000 cubits broad, and 25,000 long, from east to west. A plot of ground on the north and south, sufficient to complete this square was to support them with provisions. On the east side of the Jordan, and on the west of this square for the priests and their servants, two portions almost of equal dimensions with it, were appropriated to the prince. His lot was 25,000 cubits long, and 12,500 broad, chap. xlviii. 21. See Calmet's plan. (Haydock) \nAbout. It could not be alienated to private men, or for any other purpose. (Worthington)\n"

This both Ezekiel had knowledge of [Ezekiel 48:30-35] and the Apostle John beheld. [Revelation 21:10-23] And the word of the new prophecy which is a part of our belief, attests how it foretold that there would be for a sign a picture of this very city exhibited to view previous to its manifestation. This prophecy, indeed, has been very lately fulfilled in an expedition to the East. For it is evident from the testimony of even heathen witnesses, that in Judæa there was suspended in the sky a city early every morning for forty days. As the day advanced, the entire figure of its walls would wane gradually, and sometimes it would vanish instantly. We say that this city has been provided by God for receiving the saints on their resurrection, and refreshing them with the abundance of all really spiritual blessings, as a recompense for those which in the world we have either despised or lost; since it is both just and God-worthy that His servants should have their joy in the place where they have also suffered affliction for His name's sake. Of the heavenly kingdom this is the process. After its thousand years are over, within which period is completed the resurrection of the saints, who rise sooner or later according to their deserts there will ensue the destruction of the world and the conflagration of all things at the judgment: we shall then be changed in a moment into the substance of angels, even by the investiture of an incorruptible nature, and so be removed to that kingdom in heaven of which we have now been treating, just as if it had not been predicted by the Creator, and as if it were proving Christ to belong to the other god and as if he were the first and sole revealer of it.\n"
