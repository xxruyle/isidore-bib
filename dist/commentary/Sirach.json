        "txt": "If the Arians say that God the Father is not created and God the Son is, then, as the natural creation of the innate Father makes known the unity of nature in the Father and in the Son, so eternity by nature of the Father does not allow one to attribute a beginning to divine creation. Therefore, the Father and the Son are without beginning, and the Father and the Son are one single and true beginning. For this reason God the Father speaks to his Son in the psalm: “With you the beginning, on the day of your power, among the splendors of the saints; from the womb I have created you before the dawn.” What is “with you the beginning,” if not that which is said elsewhere of wisdom, “It comes forth from the Lord our God and has always been with him and is before the beginning of time”? Therefore, rightly so, the Son affirms himself to be the beginning since he knows that he is coeternal with the Father from the beginning, just as he knows that he by nature is one single beginning with the same Father. And affirming himself to be the alpha and the omega, that is, the beginning and the end, the Son confirms himself to be without beginning and without end. Just as, in fact, no letter exists before the alpha, in the same way no nature could possibly exist before the Son. Therefore, the Son says he is the alpha in order to demonstrate that he is the beginning of all things, before which there can be no other beginning. This is the reason why the Evangelist, wanting to express the eternity of the Word without beginning, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit has found nothing more suitable or more congruous to say than, “In the beginning was the Word.”\n"

It is said by the Spirit of prophecy, “Who shall declare his generation?” And, therefore, our Savior, in his kindness to those who were the pillars of the whole world—and since he wanted to relieve them of the burden of striving after this knowledge—told them that it was beyond their natural comprehension and that the Father alone could discern this most divine mystery. “No one,” he says, “knows the Son but the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son.” It was, I think, concerning this same subject that the Father said, “My secret is for me and for mine.”\n"

He inspired, first of all, the fear of God in the ministers of the divine worship, making them withdraw before his name, that is, making them fear and tremble when they hear the name of the Lord and driving them to experience a sentiment of reverence toward him that is not superficial but diligent, and next to which nothing is more precious. It is written, in fact, that he “who fears the Lord fares well.” And again: “The fear of the Lord is glory and exultation.” He has, therefore, guaranteed security to the one who fulfills the priesthood with sanctity and in truth. He does not simply say that they have been nourished with fear but that they were absolutely filled with fear, that is, the fear of God occupies their entire heart and soul. In this verse, the emphasis and the repetition of the words indicate to the audience the steadfastness in virtue of those who are praised.\n"

But let us begin our discussion of them from the most fitting point. And the most fitting is what Solomon laid down for us: The beginning of wisdom, he says, is to get wisdom. And what this is he tells us: The beginning of wisdom is fear. For we must not begin with contemplation and leave off with fear—for an unbridled contemplation would perhaps push us over a precipice. Rather, we must be grounded and purified and so to say made light by fear, and thus we may be raised to the height. For where fear is there is keeping of commandments, and where there is keeping of commandments there is purifying of the flesh, that cloud that covers the soul and does not allow it to see the divine Ray. And where there is purifying there is illumination, and illumination is the satisfying of desire to those who long for the greatest things, or the greatest Thing or that which surpasses all greatness.\n"

This fear keeps a person righteous against his will. Then, there is the other kind of fear that the prophet speaks about: “The one who is without fear cannot be justified.” This refers to the person who is constantly increasing in love. So, on the one hand, there are those who fear to do evil when they know they will be punished, and there are those on the other hand who do not want to lose the righteousness that brings them such joy. Therefore, where sin is concerned, one should not nourish both fears but only that one of which it is written: “Fear has to do with punishment.” For the other situations—for instance, where it is said, “The fear of God banishes sin,” and, “The one who is without fear cannot be justified,” and, “Holy is the fear of the Lord, which lasts forever and ever”—fear should not to be counted among the vices but should above all be regarded as the opponent of vices.\n"

So that you understand that this is possible, listen to what the prophet says: “Woe to those who are drunk, but not with wine.” How then can someone get drunk without wine? There are any number of different ways: anger, conceit and foolishness provoke drunkenness. In fact, any one of the destructive passions born inside of us can arouse in us a sort of drunkenness and satisfaction that obscures our reason. Drunkenness, in fact, is nothing other than the alienation of our natural sentiments, the diversion of our thoughts and the loss of consciousness. In what way, then, tell me, are those who lose their temper any different from those who get drunk through wine? They get so drunk with anger and demonstrate such intemperance to the point where they throw themselves against everyone, no matter who it is, and they have no control over their words, nor do they distinguish one person from another.In fact, just as madmen and lunatics do not notice it when they are throwing themselves into the abyss, so it is with those who lose their temper and are struck with anger. That is why a wise man who wanted to demonstrate the devastation such drunkenness can bring says, “A man’s anger tips the scale to his ruin.” Notice how succinctly he captures the enormity of this destructive passion. Now, conceit and foolishness are another form of drunkenness—and in fact even more disastrous than drunkenness. Whoever is in the grip of these passions loses, so to speak, the faculty of his senses and is not all that different from a madman. Tormented each and every day by these passions, he does not notice it until he is dragged into the very abyss of sin, taken over by evils that seem incurable. Let us therefore escape, I beg you, both the drunkenness that comes from wine and the clouding of our thoughts brought about in us through absurd passions. Let us instead listen to our common master of the universe, who says, “Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery.” Do you see how clear this expression is about the possibility of getting drunk in other ways besides drinking too much? If there were no other kind of drunkenness, why then, after having told us not to get drunk he added “with wine”? Do you see the exceeding wisdom and precision evident in his teaching through this additional phrase? After having affirmed that we should “not get drunk with wine,” he adds, “for that is debauchery,” almost seeming to indicate that this kind of excess is the root of all evils. “For that is debauchery,” he says, that is, this is the reason we lose the wealth of virtue.\n"

Observe justice, it says, and the Lord will grant you the wisdom that you desire. But only one who fears God can observe justice. “The one who is without fear cannot be justified.” Therefore, if the Lord grants wisdom to the one who observes justice, the one who is without fear will not be found just.

Our Lord—seeing that among those who want to totally renounce the things of this world there are some whose wills are prepared to do so but whose thoughts are still turned back because they fear tribulation and because they have not left behind the love of their bodies—nonetheless spoke definitively to them in a desire to disperse the hesitancy in their minds when he said, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself.”\n"

Therefore also the Israelites say to Moses and to Aaron: “The Lord proceeds against you and judges you, because you have raised us abhorrent in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his ministers, giving them the sword in their hand to kill us.” Moses and Aaron represented the Law and the Prophets.

It seeks either imperceptibly by himself, or openly through people who are subjected to his wickedness, to suffocate the incipient seeds of piety. Therefore, after having promised to the disciples the courage to preach, the Lord reveals the persecutions that would come on the part of those who would resist their preaching. In fact, he adds, “I have said this so you will not be shocked. They will chase you out of the synagogues.” Their loving Master wanted his disciples to know in advance the future hostility of the wicked, so that when it appeared it would cause them less harm, given that usually we more easily endure the adversities that we can foresee. The evils that happen to one who is not prepared and does not know what is coming often cause a more precipitous fall from their state of security. Here is the warning Solomon provides: “Son, when you come to the service of God, stand firm in justice and in fear, and prepare your soul for temptations.” And our Savior reminds his disciples that not only will they be cast out from fellowship with their fellow citizens but also they will be confronted with mortal peril. In fact, he continues, “But the hour has come in which anyone who kills you will think he is doing something in service to God.” The Jews believed they were doing something in service to God when they, full of hatred, were persecuting the ministers of the New Testament to the death, according to the testimony of the apostle: “They desire to please God, but not in an illuminated way.” And, he says about himself: “I myself believed it was my duty to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth, as I did in Jerusalem.” Therefore, after predicting the torments they would experience from their adversaries, in order to console his disciples, the Lord immediately adds, “But the hour has come in which each one who kills you will think he is doing something in service to God,” as if he were saying: accept the tribulations brought on you by your fellow citizens, but accept them even more so knowing that they are not so much inflicted on you out of hatred against you as out of zeal for the law of God.\n"

Certainly, if we were the same person in temptations that we are when at ease, there would be no need for temptations.But why do I speak of us? Since even those saints of old learned a great lesson, as the prophet says, “It was good for me that you humbled me.” And Jesus likewise said to the apostles, “In the world you will have tribulation.” And Paul alludes to just this when he says, “A thorn in the flesh was given to me; the messenger of Satan to buffet me.” Therefore when he looked for deliverance from temptation, he did not obtain it, because of the greater benefit that would follow from it. And if we should rehearse the whole life of David, we would find him more glorious when he was in danger—both he and everyone else who was like him. For such was the case with Job, who shined more brightly during his troubles, and Joseph too in this way became the more approved, and Jacob also, and his father likewise and his father’s father. For all those who ever donned such crowns of peculiar glory, it was by tribulations and temptations that they first won their crowns. Only then did they have their names recited.\nBeing conscious of all these things, according to the wise saying, let us “not be hasty in time of calamity.” Rather, let us teach ourselves only one thing: how to bear all nobly and not to be curious or inquisitive about any of the things that are happening. For to know when our tribulations will be over and done with belongs to God who permits them to happen to us. But to bear what is brought on us, with all thankfulness, is all the work of a good disposition on our part. And if this is the case, then all our blessings will follow.\n"

Three times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me; but he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’ ” With even greater clarity another passage of the Scriptures that sounds quite similar says, “Gold and silver are refined in the fire, the just, however, in the furnace of humiliation.” This is because, after the just have felt the heat of temptation and been weighed down by the burden of tribulations, there will be not even the slightest rise in them of pride over the merits of the justice they have received for their past actions, knowing that they will soon be rewarded with the very price of immortality. Indeed, the just become even more commendable in Christ when in good will they persevere in humility as those who are rich in sacred virtue and humble in heart.\n"

And after this you will be called the city of the just, a faithful city.” And again: “Just as silver and gold are tried in the furnace, so the Lord chooses the hearts.” And again, “The fire tries gold and silver, but human beings are tried in the furnace of humiliation.” And this also, “For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every child whom he receives.”\n"

Were they not therefore listened to because they were killed, and has God forsaken his servants who have contrite hearts and despised those who hope in him? Certainly not. For “who has called on God and been forsaken; who has hoped in him and been deserted by him?” Therefore, they were heard, and they were killed—and yet, they were delivered from their enemies.

Faith is the way that carries us to blessedness; lack of faith brings great misery. Because of this you will be rightly punished when you do not believe in the Son of God, because your infidelity is your vice, just as faith is your strength—although it not the kind of strength one discovers in evil spirits but the kind God gives to his saints that triumphs over their wickedness. It is the same “faith that works through love.” In fact, “the evil spirits believe and tremble,” but they do not love him from whom they are far removed because of pride. The first man was made to fall in pride through the counsel of the devil, through which he lost humility, through which he lost faith. And when he lost his faith, he lost divine protection. It is in fact written, “The one who does not believe in God will not be protected by God.” From that moment the one who was earth and ashes began to be proud because he threw away what was innermost in his life.

In order that she might become more and more worthy of these gifts, however, she kept her mind focused on the custody of humility and thus responded to the angel who had brought her the annunciation: “Behold the handmaid of the Lord, let it be to me according to your word.” As we have learned subsequently from the reading of today, she also demonstrated this same humility that she had shown the angel to humankind, and—which is even more significant—even to those who were inferior to her.Who does not know that a virgin consecrated to God has greater dignity than a married woman? Who doubts that the mother of the eternal King is to be placed before the mother of one of his soldiers? She, however, is mindful of the Scriptures that prescribe “The greater you are, the more humbly you should act in all things.” And as soon as the angel that had talked to her returned to heaven, she got up and headed for the hill country, and, carrying God in her womb, she turned to the dwelling places of the servants of God and asked to talk to them.

She entered the house of Zachariah and Elizabeth and saluted her who had learned that she would give birth to the servant and precursor of the Lord, not as if she was in doubt about the prophecy that she had received but in order to congratulate her on the gift that, as she had found out, she had received—she who was a servant of the Lord like her. She did this not to confirm the words of the angel through the testimony of a woman but for her, a young virgin, to commit herself to serve an elderly woman.\n"

In fact, according to the great apostle, “Man is the head of the woman,” and, according to Moses law, “The two shall become one flesh.” And if the married woman who has offended her husband pays the punishment for adultery according to the Law—as by now she has become the body of the husband and has chosen the man as her head—how, then, does it not follow that, once the genealogy of the head is traced, the body is also counted together with the head? As a consequence it was also necessary in this case that the Virgin, being united with Joseph, was conveniently included in his genealogy, just as we have demonstrated that she was born of the same tribe as he—yes, from the very clan and family of David. And therefore also Gabriel foretold in the prophecy addressed to her, among other things: “And the Lord God shall give him the throne of his father David.” And what did he teach through this? That David was the forefather of him who was to be born from her. And how would it have been possible that the angel conveniently manifested these things to the Virgin, if not with the clear recognition that she descended from David? Indeed, if she had not been a descendent of David, he would not have said, “God shall give him the throne of his father David.” And had it not been clear that what he said was addressed to a daughter of David’s, the Virgin could have rightly asked, “Of which father?” since she knew that she had not known a man. She then learned that she would conceive through the Holy Spirit. Therefore Luke rightly says, “Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.” We, then, having this interpretation ever since it came to light, no longer read this discourse ambiguously, as if Mary had only come to be enrolled together with him. Rather, it was because she also was of the house and the family of David. I believe that it has been clearly demonstrated that the genealogy of Joseph has not been uselessly traced by the divine Evangelists, because as a consequence of this the Virgin has been recognized as a descendant of David’s, and thus Christ Jesus, born of her through a supreme miracle, is the Son of God who precedes all ages. And whoever attempts to contradict these words attempts above all to point the sword of his tongue against himself. And he shall be thrown out of the sacred gates of our hall! And in our turn, to us, to whom the Word of God has been sent along with grace and truth, it shall not be justifiable to probe anything further than that which has been said, since the divine Scripture closes the search for more profound things! In fact, it says, “Take care of what has been commanded to you; do not probe the things that are too high for you!”\n"

He says “except the Spirit of God” also because “it is the Spirit of God who probes everything, even the depths of God.” We therefore do not say that his Spirit, who also probes the depths of God, is a stranger to God. Holy Scripture cautions us, “Reflect on what has been assigned to you, for you do not need what is hidden,” or, “Seek not what is too difficult for you; nor investigate what is beyond your power.” Of course, we cannot apply words that condemn vain curiosity to the Holy Spirit. We should say only that it is part of his nature to investigate the hidden things of God.\n"

Our Savior demonstrates as much. Indeed, after the resurrection, breathing on his disciples and giving them the gift of the Holy Spirit, he gave them the power to forgive sins, saying, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of anyone, they shall be forgiven; if you retain them, they will be retained.” Therefore, they do not close the door of mercy—an action that would create a desperation that leads to death—on those who, separated from the catholic church, are tied to the error of whatever heresy or schism. Those heretics or schismatics will give up their hard-heartedness if they do not want to be punished with evils that will have no end. It is indeed written that “the stubborn mind will be afflicted at the end, and whoever loves danger will perish by it.” What is there that is more dangerous than not offering obedience to the divine Word and disdaining the will of God who calls? Therefore, in the book of holy Job, just as eternal glory is promised to those who convert, the impious are denied the gifts of salvation because they do not obey. If indeed it is written, “Those who return from iniquity, if they listen and obey, will fill their days with blessings and their years with honor. But he does not preserve the ungodly because they are not willing to know the Lord and because when reproved they were disobedient,” they therefore ought not to disdain the time dedicated to obedience but ought to return to the catholic church in which alone, through the gift of the Holy Spirit, “love covers a multitude of sins.”\n"

Stop doing evil; learn to do good. Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the orphan, defend the widow. And come, reason with me, says the Lord, and though your sins were as scarlet, yet they shall be as white as snow, though they were red as crimson, they shall be as white as wool.”\n"

He invites us to spend the goods of our earthly belongings! He says, “Honor the Lord with your belongings.” Everything that is given to us is his, and yet, he affirms that it is ours so that we can give it away. Thus, he calls the ownership of these possessions ours so that there may be a greater reward for work since we spend more time and effort on possessions that belong to us, and in this way the worker necessarily receives a considerably greater reward for his labor.The Lord has said that the ownership is ours. However, in order that our soul not become too proud, he adds, “Pay back your debt.” If a person is not induced to be generous from his devotion, however, he will be constrained to pay from necessity. If faith is of no help to persuade a saint to operate, that which obliges him to satisfy his debt will motivate him. First he says, “Honor the Lord with your possessions,” and then, “Pay your debt,” so that, if you are devoted, you should give as though it belonged to you; if you are not, provide restitution as though it were not yours. Thus, God has rightly fixed in the law both the will to give and the necessity to pay.\nHe wants to say to everyone, “You are invited with persuasive words or constricted by contracted debt to do holy deeds. Give, if you want; provide restitution in the contrary case.” The apostle also provided similar teaching when he ordered the rich not to be proud, not to put hope on the uncertainty of riches but on God, who, he says, “gives us everything in abundance, which we can enjoy in the will to do good works.’ ” It is one phrase, but with this the apostle teaches us who is the benefactor and what is the reason for the possessions that have been given.\n"

There are, in fact, true witnesses and false witnesses. But the Scripture affirms, “The false witness will not remain unpunished.” If the false one does not remain unpunished, then the true witness will not remain without rewards. Certainly, it would be an easy thing to render testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ and to the truth of him being God; but it would be an assignment arduous enough to render it until death. There were some leaders of the Jews, cited in the Gospel, who believed in the Lord Jesus; but because of the Jews, it is said, they did not dare to recognize him publicly. And it is immediately noted down in the passage; in fact, the Evangelist, continuing, affirms, “For they loved the glory of people more than the glory of God.” There were, then, those who, before people, were ashamed to recognize Christ; there were still others, certainly better, who were not ashamed to recognize Christ before people, but who were incapable of confessing him unto death. In fact, the gifts of God are such that sometimes they only gradually develop themselves in the soul. First pay attention, then confront among them these three categories of witnesses: the first includes he who believes in Christ and hardly manages to whisper his name; the next, he who believes in Christ and recognizes him openly; the third, he who believes in Christ and, in his confession, is ready to die for Christ. The first is so weak that his shame prevails over his fear; the second already puts on a brave face, but not yet until the blood; the third has everything, so there is nothing left to be desired. He meets in fact all that is written: “He fights until death for the truth.”\n"

You have heard that there are two sanctuaries, one visible and open to the priests, the other invisible and inaccessible—except for the one high priest, all the rest of whom remain outside. I think that this first sanctuary could be understood as this sanctuary we now occupy, which is our flesh: in this the priests serve at the altar of burnt offerings9 on which that fire is lit of which Jesus has said, “I have come to cast the fire on the earth, and I wish that it were already kindled.” Do not marvel that this sanctuary is open only to priests since all those who have been united with the ointment of the holy chrism have become priests, as Peter also says to the entire church: “You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.” You are therefore of priestly descent, and thus you have access to the sanctuary. Furthermore, each one of us has in him his burnt offering and lights the altar with his sacrifice, so that it always burns. If I renounce all that I possess, I take up my cross and follow Christ, I offer a burnt offering at the altar of God; or “if I give my body to be burnt, having charity” and if I obtain the glory of martyrdom, I offer myself in a burnt offering at the altar of God. If I love my brothers, up to “giving my life for my brothers,” if “I fight until death for justice, for the truth,” I offer a burnt offering at the altar of God. If I let my limbs die at each temptation of the flesh, if “the world is crucified for me and I for the world,” I offer a burnt offering at the altar of God, and I myself become the priest of my victim.\n"

In that case, you end up not repenting and incur instead the sentence of Wisdom, which says, “I also will laugh at your destruction.” How then does the Lord treat those who are in danger from both these maladies? To those who are in danger from presumption, he says, “Do not be slow in turning to the Lord. Do not put it off from day to day, for suddenly his anger will come and in the time of vengeance will utterly destroy you.” To those who are in danger from despair, what does he say? “In whatever day the wicked person shall be converted, I will forget all his iniquities.” Accordingly, for the sake of those who are in danger because of despair, he has offered us a refuge of pardon.

But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed. For he will render to everyone according to his works.” The fear of God must therefore take hold in your heart. If you do not want to sin, you should reflect on the fact that God is always present with you. This is the case not only in public but also in your own home, and not only in your home but in your own room, even at night in your very own bed, in your heart. If, then, you abolish the safe haven of penance and repentance, sins would increase out of desperation. As you see, those who think that the safe haven of repentance presented by the Christian faith is an occasion for sin have nothing more to say.And what happens next? Shouldn’t God have made provision for preventing sin from increasing since people would count on there being this hope of forgiveness? In other words, just as he has provided that sin would not be added to because of desperation, he should also make sure that sin also would not be added to because of hope. In reality, the person who despairs adds to his sins just as much as the one who counts on forgiveness. You might even say to yourself, “In the meantime, I will do what I want. Then, when I repent, God is good and will forgive me.”\nYou certainly can say to yourself, “When I convert, he will forgive me”—if you know you will be alive tomorrow. Don’t the Scriptures warn you, though, saying, “Do not delay turning back to the Lord or put it off from day to day; for suddenly his wrath will come, and in the time of vengeance he will destroy you.” You see, divine Providence has kept watch over us, allowing us to avoid one or the other danger: in order to make sure we do not increase our sin out of despair, there is the safe haven of repentance; in order to make sure we do not increase them out of excessive hope of forgiveness, the day of our demise has been made unknown.\n"

In the Psalms they are told, “You hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you.” If someone will not consent to this divine Word until he is on his way, that is, if he does not consent soon in this life, then once he is thrown into prison, into the eternal fire, there will be no more peace. In fact, the best adversary is the one who is hostile toward us in keeping us away from the hostility of sin that is the bearer of death. We learn from another passage of Scripture that we should repent soon because the more we delay our repentance, the more chance death has to lead us to damnation instead of salvation. And so Scripture says, “Do not delay turning back to the Lord or put it off from day to day; for suddenly his wrath will come, and in the time of vengeance he will destroy you.” The Word of God reveals that when the time of vengeance arrives, our repentance will certainly not deliver us from the pain of punishment; rather, God’s vengeful wrath will give us the sentence we deserve. This, in fact, will not be a time of forgiveness or of indulgence but of vengeance. It is deferred due to the long-suffering of God as he waits for the full number of saints to be completed. The blessed John recalls in the Apocalypse that the saints have in fact asked for this vengeance when they cry out, “O sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” And in order to teach that the time of vengeance is deferred, by divine disposition, because of those who still must join this gathering, John continues, “Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren should be complete.”\n"

What need was there to ask when he had arrived? Or what advantage would have resulted from knowing? We must then seek wisdom from the wise and let a prudent silence be preferred over inept speeches. For the apostle exhorts us to flavor our speech with salt, and another of the wise invites us with similar words: “If you have understanding, answer your neighbor; but if you do not, put your hand on your mouth.” And we also learn from another place how evil it is to be condemned for any recklessness of language: “If any one thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man’s religion is vain.”\n"

Second, everyone should put in check his own will in order to avoid thinking that he is the only wise and sensible person around, preferring his own opinions to those of his neighbor. Third, they said that he should know to defer everything, even the things that he considers useful and necessary, when it will benefit charity and peace. Fourth, he should be convinced that he must not anger himself for no reason at all, whether the anger is just or unjust. Fifth, he should desire that the anger of his brother be assuaged like his own, even if that anger rises against him without reason, knowing that the pain of the one is equally damaging to both; if he lashes out against someone else, he will make every effort to remove that offense of his brother as well. Finally, he should believe that every day might be his last, which sentiment undoubtedly brings about the death of any vice. This conviction not only leaves no place for any sadness in our heart but furthermore stops any movement of evil desire and impedes all sins. Whoever, then, respects these things cannot experience or carry out the bitterness of anger and discord.\n"

Until, then, this corruptible puts on incorruption, and this mortal puts on immortality, the weak flesh will imprison the willing spirit. No one feels these fetters except those who groan inwardly, who are burdened5 and wanting to be clothed with the tabernacle that is from heaven, because death is terrifying and mortal life brings sorrow. The prophet redoubles his own groaning in behalf of these individuals who are suffering so that their groaning may come before the sight of the Lord.Those who are bound by the disciplines of wisdom may also be understood to be fettered.

In fact, our Savior says, “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.” Indeed, also in the book of Psalms it is written that “the Lord is close to all who call on him in truth. He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him, and he will hear their prayers, and he will save them.” Therefore also in Proverbs each one of us is ordered both to fear the Lord and to distance ourselves from evil. There you can read, “Fear the Lord and turn away from all evil, and your body shall have peace and your bones rest.” In fact, also in Ecclesiasticus, all the faithful are warned not to do evil with these words: “Do not perform evil deeds, and they will not seize you. Distance yourself from evil, and evil will distance itself from you. Do not sow evil deeds in the furrows of injustice, and you will not harvest them multiplied seven times.” In the same book again, because no one, adding sin to sin, wants to deceive himself with a vain thought regarding the mercy of God, the doctrine of salvation meets us with words of this kind: “Do not … add sin to sin. Do not say, ‘His mercy is great, he will forgive the multitude of my sins,’ for both mercy and wrath are with him, and his anger rests on sinners.” Again, saint Job says, “Does not calamity befall the unrighteous and disaster the workers of iniquity?” It is written in Proverbs, “The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is caught in the toils of his sin. He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is lost.”\n"

And those who mourn their transgressions certainly throw up by confession the wickedness that wickedly sated them and that oppressed the innermost parts of their soul. And yet, in going back to it again after confession, they take it in again. But the sow, by wallowing in the mire when washed, is made more filthy. And one who mourns past transgressions yet does not leave them behind subjects himself to the penalty of an even worse sin, since he both despises the very pardon that he might have won by his weeping and as it were rolls himself in the mire, because in withholding purity of life from his weeping he makes even his very tears filthy before the eyes of God. Thus again it is written, “Do not repeat a word in your prayer.” For to repeat a word in prayer, after wailing about it, is to commit what again requires wailing. And so it is said through Isaiah, “Wash and be clean.” For whoever does not maintain an innocent life after his tears of repentance have been shed is neglecting the cleanliness he received after washing. They are indeed washed but are in no way clean when they are the ones who do not stop crying about the things they have committed but then go on to commit again the very things they were crying about. This is why a certain wise man said, “He that is cleansed from the touch of a dead body and touches it again—what good did his washing do?” For indeed he is cleansed from the touch of a dead body who is cleansed from sin by weeping.

For thus it is written: “Do you have daughters? Be concerned for their chastity, and do not show yourself too indulgent with them.” Evil souls that are inclined toward worldly desires are sometimes better served through severity. A fixed gaze accompanied by severe vigilance that offers no hope for any frivolous indulgence frightens the wayward soul and rigorously pulls it away from any enticement toward vice. But even as a master does this, he must always preserve in his heart tenderness and humility toward him in so far as he must have a great deal of love for the individual and should never use his position of authority against him through pride. Nevertheless, he still must refrain from revealing his love and tender regard for the individual’s own good.\n"

For this reason a wise man warned, “If you give surety, be concerned as one who must pay.” Now then, if those who vouch for someone concerning money render themselves responsible for everything, how much more do those who vouch for someone relating to spiritual things and on the theme of virtue must demonstrate great vigilance, exhorting, advising, correcting and revealing paternal affection. And they should understand that what is happening should not be taken lightly but that their own reputation is at stake. There will be mutual benefit if through their personal admonition they lead them someone onto the road of virtue, while a grave condemnation will be incumbent on them if they neglect to do so. For this reason, it is customary to call these people spiritual parents, so that they may learn what affection they must demonstrate for them with their own deeds in the teaching of spiritual things.

In fact, beauty is the work of the wisdom of God. And a work of God could never become the cause of wickedness. Was it, then, a sin for having seen them? No, for this is also nature’s work. What is it then? Having seen them with evil intentions—that, indeed, is very much the result of a corrupt will. Therefore also a wise man provided this exhortation: “Do not gaze on the beauty of others.” He did not say, “Do not look,” because it so happens that this occurs spontaneously; rather, he says, “Do not gaze on,” excluding the intentional consideration, the importunate gaze, the prolonged contemplations that derive from a corrupt soul and are prey to desire. But what damage, if one objects, could derive from this? “Following this,” it is said, “love lights up like fire.” Like fire, indeed, after it has reached hay or straw does not waste time but simultaneously sticks to wood and ignites a splendid flame, so also the fire of desire that is within us, after it becomes glued to a beautiful and splendid image through the instrumentality of the eyes, immediately burns the souls of the one who watches.\n"

Therefore, what he promised in the Old he has brought to fulfillment in the New. Since therefore the knowledge of the mysteries of the New Testament can be truly salutary and joyful only if one acknowledges that the promise that went before in the mysteries of the Old Testament is true, when the Scriptures says, “Do not leave an old friend because the new one will not be like him,” there is immediately added, “A new friend is like new wine; when it has aged, you will drink it with pleasure.” What does “aged” mean except that the type4 of the New Testament appears in the Old Testament? This new wine is thus drunk with joy if its meaning and promise are acknowledged in the Old Testament.\n"

As sacred Scripture says, “There is nothing more wicked than a miser.” Wealth kept from one’s Lord does the worst and most deadly kind of damage. This is an incontrovertible truth! What is worse or more horrible than for anyone to change the asset we enjoy in the world into disasters for the future? What is worse than the fact that death and damnation are pursued with these very things that have been given to us by the Lord for the purpose of obtaining a true eternally happy life from them? But we must also contemplate the fact that if wealth held in trust is a source of trouble for people, piling up more wealth without stopping to see what it is doing constitutes an even more serious calamity. Who among the rich, in fact, is equipped with the kind of temperament that can limit himself to conserve and not to increase his assets? Our present time is indeed wretched and deplorable in which people reduce themselves to this. Scripture asserts that it is a serious crime to even keep money. Today, people believe it is a virtue not only to keep but also to add to their wealth. Once again, therefore, we ask: How can someone think he or she is undamaged by guilt, if even at the moment of death, having no thought for salvation, people do not donate the assets they possess, since they have already committed a crime in keeping them until the moment they depart this life? How will these people not be guilty who, by a predilection toward vanity that is completely sacrilegious, leave their wealth to just anyone, especially since those who have not deprived themselves of at least a portion of their possessions for the worship of God will be found guilty in this life? The same Lord is our master in this matter as well. Through the apostle he says, “And now to you who are rich: weep over the disaster that will come on you! Your wealth is corrupted, and your gold and silver are consumed by rust; their rust will be raised in testimony against you and will devour your flesh like fire. You have accumulated treasures for the last days!”\n"

And so, what is said of proud mortal humanity, clad in the tattered rags of the flesh, weighed down with the weight of a corruptible body, and all the while extolling himself, and forgetting the very skin he is clothed with—what, I ask, do the Scriptures say to him? “Why is dust and ashes proud?” Why proud! Let the Scriptures tell why. “Because in his life he put forth his inmost parts.” What does “put forth” mean except that he “threw it far away”? In other words, to send them out. For to enter within is to long after the inmost parts; to put forth the inmost parts is to send them out. The proud man gets rid of the inmost parts, the humble man earnestly desires the inmost parts. If we are cast out by pride, let us return by humility.\n"

Therefore, how can human nature restore its own health without the aid of a physician since, while it was healthy, it could not even succeed in safeguarding its health then? Therefore, earth and ash should not get puffed up because it has abandoned its most visceral thoughts in this life; nor should the wounded act as if he were healthy because he thinks he has healed that part of himself. Rather, he should reflect with the humility of a wounded heart on the putridness of his wounds so that, proclaiming with the prophet, “My wounds grow foul and fester because of my foolishness,” he can obtain healing not because of his own merit but because of the free gift of divine mercy. In fact, what does a person possess that he has not already received? But if he has received it, then why does he glory in himself as if he had not received it?\n"

Why does he praise with his mouth the works he has done, if not because in the midst of the plagues and of the words that could otherwise drive him to despair, he leads his soul back to hope? He who was humble in prosperity remembers his merits and thus does not lose heart in his adversity. In the midst of many scourges, indeed, these words would have induced despair in the soul of anyone who could not have recalled to his own memory the good he had done. The holy person, therefore, having to listen to all these evil things, saw his mind driven to desperation. He did everything he could to anchor himself in the secure hope of his own good works. Thus is fulfilled what is written: “On good days remember the bad, on bad days remember the good.” If, indeed, when we have good days we remember the bad ones that we have already suffered or that we may yet suffer, we do not think overly highly of ourselves for the good things that we have received because the fear that springs from the memory of the bad things we have experienced contains the joy we have over the good things that have happened to us.

For everything that is secured or preserved by care can also be lost by carelessness. And so we read, “Call no one happy before his death,” because so long as an individual is still engaged in the struggle, and if I may use the expression, still wrestling—even though he generally conquers and carries off many prizes of victory—yet he can never be free from fear and from the suspicion of an uncertain outcome. And therefore God alone is called unchangeable and good because his goodness is not the result of effort, but he possesses it naturally, and so he cannot be anything but good. No virtue then can be acquired by an individual without the possibility of change.

One of them had God the Savior at his own table; another had the angels as his guests; one received as a reward a son at his advanced age; the other his own salvation, fleeing from Sodom. This is what the apostle is talking about when he exhorts us to imitate them: “Do not neglect to show hospitality; for thereby some have received angels without knowing it.” It happens, however, that the one who offers hospitality has the prudence of the serpent and the simplicity of the dove, thus complying with the double precept of the Lord: “Give to every one who asks of you,” and, “Do not bring such a person into your home.” This is so that you do not run the danger of bringing a wolf to the place where the lamb dwells or a bear to the place where the ox resides, with the risk of turning your gain into a loss. It is first of all necessary to be aware of the place where you are—if it is deserted or has frequent visitors. Then, you must also be aware of your own ability to tolerate characters that are too difficult. Finally, you must well consider who it is who is destined to receive your benefits—whether he is rich or poor, healthy or weak, in need of food or clothes. These are the areas where acts of mercy come into play. In reality, the blessed Abraham did not receive into his home consuls, captains, the important people of this temporary world like those who have horses with bridles and glittering stirrups and whose harnesses, burnished with bronze, belch forth from afar the resonance of their pride. On the contrary, Abraham lived in a deserted place and welcomed all who passed by. Those who traveled the desert went to the patriarch because they were attracted by his virtue and because they were reduced to being beggars, which is about as extreme a poverty as you can get. In a similar way Lot, who lived in the worst city of that same desert, rightly welcomed all who passed by, given the customs of those inhabitants.\n"

Those who already distribute compassionately what they possess are to be admonished also so that they might learn how to be vigilant, lest, when they redeem by alms the sins they have committed, they commit others that will still require redemption; otherwise they might suppose that the righteousness of God is for sale, thinking that if they take care to give money for their sins, they can sin with impunity.\n"

And so, after he sends it away, ordering that terrible beast to stay away from us, if we—even after we have been saved from its clutches and it has been chased into its cave—covered with a thousand wounds still go looking for it again and get it roused up and excited again, then he will not have further pity on us, and he will not save us: “Who, in fact, will have pity on a snake charmer bitten by a serpent and on those who get close to the wild beasts?”\n"

And what he says here has a very apt connection with what precedes. For, if the keeping of his commandments or his word is a clear proof of love toward him, surely the converse of this will be true. For treating his bidding as of no account and thrusting his commandment aside will be a sign that we refuse to love him, since these are the acts of people inured to evildoing. But just as he promised that together with God the Father he would abide with those who keep his laws, for the same reason, I think, he will pass away from and wholly abandon those who do the reverse. For thus the truth of Solomon’s saying will be seen: “Into the soul of the one who makes iniquity wisdom will not enter or dwell in the body given over to sin.” For in common life you can observe that a similar result follows: for does not a person gain a reputation by conversing with those who are like-minded and who choose the same path of life, rather than with others? And “every creature loves his own,” according to the saying, and “people will seek union with his own kind.” And if it seems most desirable even among ourselves to live with those of similar habits to ourselves, how can we escape the reflection that this is still more the case with God? For as he is good by nature and the beginning and source of all virtue, he takes up his abode not in the lovers of wickedness but in the workers of virtue and disdains the impure.\n"

It is, without a doubt, the face that every day renews itself in the image of the one who created it, the one who in itself finds no spot or wrinkle but is holy and immaculate, which Christ has presented to himself as the church, that is, the souls who have come to perfection who altogether form the body of the church. Such a body will appear beautiful if the souls who compose it remain in every grace of perfection. In fact, just as an angry soul distorts the face of the body and disturbs it but when it is found in a state of tranquility and peace renders a countenance that is peaceful and mild, so also the face of the church in relation to the attitudes and the feelings of believers is defined as graceful or ugly, according to what we read written: “A cheerful countenance is the token of a heart that is in prosperity,” and again, “The face of the light hearted is filled with laughter, but it is morose if the heart is found in sadness.” Therefore the heart is happy when it has the Spirit of God in itself, whose firstfruit is love and whose second is joy.

And Solomon says, “There is no one on earth so just that he does only good and never sins.” And the psalmist, “I said with dismay, ‘Everyone is false.’ ” And John the Evangelist, “If we say that we are without sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” To which it can be replied that there are different kinds of falling short, since the elect fall short in a different way than reprobates, according to Solomon’s testimony: “Because if the just person falls seven times, he gets up, but the impious succumb to disaster.” Indeed, if the just individual falls short through the weakness of the flesh or through ignorance, he does not cease to be just, since, as this type of failure is daily and inevitable, so also is the remedy of prayer and good works always at hand.

And after this, with the Lord now describing this, it is said, “toward Africa,” that is, toward the west, the boundary of that place should be observed, and of that place toward the east, and thus the Lord indicates through the four regions of the sky certain names that the people of God ought to keep in that earthly Judea.Thus one of the more simple hearers will say that here there are things that are necessary and useful even according to the letter, in that no one should go beyond the borders that have been appointed through the Lord’s command and one tribe should not dare to violate the boundaries of another. And what will we do when no possibility remains for the Jews, not merely to invade the borders of another nation in these lands but even of possessing them at all? For they have been banished from that land, they are exiles and refugees, and those who now possess and guard the boundaries are not those whom the divine law appointed but those whom they have entrusted the rights of victors. What, I ask, will we do, who read these things in the church? If we read them according to the sense of the Jews, they will seem superfluous to us and pointless.\nBut I am one who reads what is written about Wisdom: “I went out after her as a tracker.” I want to go out after her, and since I do not find her in the physical realities, I desire to pursue her tracks and investigate where she is going and to see into which rooms she leads my understanding. For I think that if I am able to follow her with care and to investigate her ways, she will give me some opportunities from the Scriptures to understand how it is, even in these passages we need to explain, if we believe what Paul says in a mystery, that those who serve through the law are serving “the shadow and image of heavenly things.” And if, no less in accordance with the judgment of that man, the law, of which this reading that we have in hand is a portion, “contains a shadow of the good things to come,” it seems logical and necessary that everything that is described in the law, as it were concerning earthly things, is a shadow of the good things of heaven; and the whole inheritance of that land, which is called the “holy land” and the “good land,” is an image of the good things of heaven. These things, as we have said, that are mentioned as good things on earth contain a shadow and an image of these.\n"

Thus it is that sinners, and all those who have alienated themselves from the catholic church, heretics and schismatics, since they are excluded from glorifying God with the saints, cannot properly even continue as observers of the feast.\n"

For “from the mouth of a sinner praise is not attractive.” In fact, the prophet says about souls like this, “Why do you declare my righteous acts and take my covenant in your lips?” They never possess in any lasting way the fear of the Lord of which it is said, “The fear of the Lord is instruction and wisdom.” And yet, they try to get at the meaning of Scripture by continual meditation on them.

Who, I ask, would not flee torment, punishment and death and not choose rest, forgiveness and life? One flees death, however, who walks in the ways of the precepts that give life. One attains the gift of life who, through the effort of his commitment to spiritual things, avoids actions that bring death. This is why it was said, “Here is water and fire. Reach out your hand” (that is, your actions) “to what you will.” By the hand are meant actions, since we cannot be subjected to sufferings without offenses or merit the prize without a fight, since the apostle says, “Is God unjust in inflicting his wrath?” And also, “Because no one who takes part in a contest is crowned unless he competes according to the rules.”\n"

Then select the better ones from the number of the faithful: it is certain that the number will be far lower. And again, from those whom you have chosen, select the more perfect ones: you will find even fewer. And the more you continue to make choices, the more you will find them to be scanty and very few, until you finally come to a certain one who confidently says, “I labored more than all of them.”Thus, “those who are more” will receive more land and more of a physical inheritance, but the “few” will attain to a small amount of land, since they have more in the Lord; but some will receive no earthly inheritance, if they become worthy to be priests and ministers of God; for “of these” the Lord will be their whole inheritance. And who is so blessed that among the few he receives either a small amount of land or that among the chosen priests and ministers he merits in the allotment of his inheritance to have room for the Lord alone? For granted they receive some land on account of their beasts of burden, yet it is from that land that borders on cities and is attached to cities.\nYet these words that say that the inheritance is multiplied to those who are more can be understood in still another way as well. For one just person is considered as “more” in accordance with the fact that “he is accepted by God.” After all, it is even written, “Through one wise person a city will be considered, but the tribes of the unjust will be desolated.” And one just person is reckoned for the whole world, but the unjust, even if they are many, are considered by God as scanty and as nothing.\nSo there is a praiseworthy multitude, as we see was said to Abraham as well, when “he led him outside and said to him: look at the sky if you are able to number the stars; thus will be your seed.” Consider here how the just person is interior and always abides in what is interior, since it is “inside” that “he prays to the Father in secret,” and “all the glory of the king’s daughter,” that is, of the royal soul, “is within.” Nevertheless, God “leads him outside,” when circumstances demand it and the rational order of visible things demands it. Therefore, even in this way, to the many who are “as the stars of heaven in multitude,” an inheritance is multiplied; and to the scanty few, namely, those who, even if they are many in number, nevertheless are considered scanty due to the unworthiness and commonness of their life, a scanty inheritance is appointed.\n"

Indeed, since he created everything not only because he felt generous at that moment but especially because he already knew the future, he provided solitary places. I think he did this for the saints who would frequent them—this is how I see it. God wanted to give the places that are rich in fruit to others and to the saints, instead of those more generous lands, this fruitful one. In this way the deserts would also become fertile, and the valleys would be covered with abundant crops, while he “from on high would water the mountains,” thus remedying the unproductiveness of those places, filling a barren place with inhabitants.\n"

O Lord, listen to my voice.” But it is different if the disaster found in another Scripture has happened to the sinner: “One who is devoid of reverence sinks deep into sin and is defiant.” The pit has closed its mouth on him. In what sense does it mean that it closed its mouth? It has plugged the sinner’s mouth shut. When the sinner refuses to confess his own guilt, then he is truly dead, and it has been fulfilled in him what is said elsewhere, “A confession coming from a dead person is like one who does not exist.” Brothers and sisters, we must greatly fear such a disaster. If you see someone commit a sin, consider that person as though he or she were sunk in the pit. But if, at present, you point out the person’s sin and he says to you, “I have sinned. I truly confess,” the pit has not yet closed its mouth on him. If instead you hear that person saying, “Is what I have done that bad?” then he has become a defender of his sin and the pit has closed its mouth. There is no way for him to be pulled back outside. Clearly if there is no confession, there is no recourse to mercy. If you defend your sin, how can God free you from it?

What need was there to enumerate these six days in such a precise and ordered way? Surely it was necessary for those who cannot arrive at a comprehension that “God created everything at the same time,” that Scripture accompanied them more slowly, step by step, to the final goal of the story to which it was leading them.\n"

Therefore it is said in another place, “Seek his face always.” For even as he satisfies the seeker to the utmost of his capacity, he makes the finder still more capable so that he may seek to be newly filled according to the growth of his ability to receive. Therefore it was not said, “Seek his face always,” in the same sense as of certain others, who are “always learning and never coming to a knowledge of the truth.” Rather, as the preacher says, “When a person has finished, then he begins,” till we reach that life where we shall be so filled that our natures shall attain their utmost capacity because we shall have arrived at perfection and will no longer be aiming at more. For then all that can satisfy us will be revealed to our eyes. But here let us always be seeking, and let our reward in finding put no end to our searching. For we do not say that it will not be so always, because it is only so here. Rather, here we say we must always be seeking, lest at any time we should imagine that here we can ever cease from seeking.\n"

This in fact is what the blessed apostle knew and taught when he ordered us “to live soberly and with justice and piety in this world,” teaching that those who before the judgment have led a just life in this world will receive mercy in the judgment. Therefore divine Scripture warns us in the book of Ecclesiasticus, “Procure justice before the judgment, and you will find propitiation in the presence of God.” Therefore, anyone who wants to find propitiation in the presence of God must prepare justice for himself here.

But this is certainly not the case. For by “the flesh,” he does not mean the body. If he did, what would be the sense of the clause immediately following, “For it lusts,” he says, “against the Spirit”? And yet, the body does not move but is moved. It is not an agent but is acted on. How then does it lust, because lust belongs to the soul, not to the body? For in another place it is said, “My soul longs,” and, “Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you,” and, “Do not walk according to the desires of your soul,” and, “My soul pants.” Why then does Paul say, “The flesh lusts against the Spirit”? He usually refers to the flesh as the depraved will, not the natural body, as when he says, “But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit,” and again, “Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” What then? Is the flesh to be destroyed? Was not he who thus spoke clothed with flesh? Such doctrines are not of the flesh but from the devil, for “he was a murderer from the beginning.” What then is his meaning? It is the earthly mind, slothful and careless, that he here calls the flesh, and this is not an accusation of the body but a charge against the slothful soul. The flesh is an instrument, and no one feels aversion and hatred toward an instrument, but to him who abuses it. For it is not the instrument of iron but the murderer whom we hate and punish.\n"

Both old and young let themselves go during the banquets. Individuals who were already too weak to live were nonetheless daunting in their wine drinking; those nearly incapable of walking were still sturdy in their drinking; those otherwise uncertain in their steps were agile and lively in their dancing.What is there left to say? Well, they were so filthy in all the evils of which I have spoken that the saying of the sacred text came true that says, “Wine and women make men fall away from God.” And, in fact, while they were drinking, amusing themselves, having sex and going crazy, they did begin to deny Christ.

What am I saying? To use the tongue only for hymns, for praise, for the reading of the divine judgments and for spiritual conversation. As it says, “Let there be speech that is good for edifying, conferring grace on the listeners. And do not grieve the spirit of God in whom you have been sealed.” Do you know that to fail to do this is to sadden the Holy Spirit? Therefore, I implore you, try to do nothing that saddens the Holy Spirit. If we must go out, let us not attend dangerous or unreasonable meetings, full of foolishness. Rather, prefer nothing to the church of God, to houses of prayer and to meetings where spiritual things are discussed. And let each of our actions be very dignified. As it says, “A person’s attire, his laughter and his gait reveal who he is.” The external posture can be a clear image of the condition of the soul; indeed, the movement of the members reveals its beauty in a particular way. If we go into the town square, let our gait, our serenity and our composure be such as to attract the notice of those we encounter, let our eye not roam or our feet walk in a disorderly manner, and let our tongue proffer words with tranquility and gentleness. In other words, let our entire exterior disposition indicate the interior beauty of the soul. Let our behavior be already as though foreign and transformed, because the things that we do are new and foreign, as the blessed Paul indicates when he says, “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature.”\n"

The tongue, therefore, should be discreetly curbed, not tied up fast. For it is written, “A wise person will hold his tongue until the opportune time.” He will do this in order that when he considers it opportune, he can with assurance relinquish the censorship of silence and apply himself to the helpful service by speaking such things as are appropriate. And again it is written, “There is a time to keep silence and a time to speak.” For, indeed, the appropriate time for each should be discreetly weighed just in case, on the one hand, when the tongue should be restrained it is allowed to run loose to no profit in what is said, or, on the other hand, when it could say something profitably, it shirks its duty and restrains itself. The psalmist spoke of this well when he said, “Set a watch, O Lord, on my mouth, and guard the door of my lips.” For he is not looking for a wall to set about his lips but a door—in other words, something that can be opened or shut. This is something we need to learn with discretion so that we use our voice in a discreet and fitting time to open the mouth, and at the appropriate time also let silence close it. But those who spend time in much speaking are to be admonished that they vigilantly note from what a state of being in the right they fall away when they flow forth in a multitude of words. For the human mind is just like water, which, when closed in is collected to higher levels because it seeks again the height from which it descended. By the same token, when that water is let loose, it falls away in that it disperses itself unprofitably through the lowest places.\n"

Let them perceive, then, in what guilt those are implicated who, in withholding the word of preaching from their sinning brethren, hide away the remedies of life from dying souls. Concerning this, a certain wise man also well says, “Wisdom that is hid and treasure that is unseen—what profit is in them both?” If a famine were wasting away the people, and they themselves kept hidden corn, undoubtedly they would be the authors of death. Let them consider therefore with what punishment they must be visited who, when souls are perishing from famine of the Word, do not supply the bread of grace that they have themselves received. Solomon also had something good to say about this: “He who hides corn shall be cursed among the people.” For to hide corn is to retain for one’s self the words of sacred preaching.

Truth testifies the same thing through the mouth of John when against those who were approaching him he said, “Generation of vipers! Who made you to believe that you could escape from the coming wrath? Produce fruit therefore in keeping with repentance, and do not say to yourselves, ‘We are descendants of Abraham,’ because I assure you that God is able to raise up children of Abraham from these stones. The ax is already at the root of the trees, ready to cut; every tree that does not yield good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” This is the fruit about which he had said in the preceding phrase, “Produce fruits in keeping with repentance.” Anyone who does not produce such fruits has no reason to believe that an unfruitful penance will merit the forgiveness of sins. And what these fruits are, the same John indicates, because after he had said these things, “The crowds questioned him, saying, ‘What shall we do?’ ” that is, what are these fruits that he was pressing them to produce. “And he answered, ‘Whoever possesses two cloaks should give one to the person who has none, and he should do the same with his provisions.’ ” It is an unambiguous, clear, explicit answer. So what is the meaning of what he said first, “Every tree that does not yield fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire,” except what those who are on his left are going to hear to whom he says, “Be gone into the eternal fire, for I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat.” It is not enough therefore just to stop sinning if we neglect repairing the guilt of the past. In fact, Scripture says, “Son, have you sinned? Sin no more.” However, if you think that this alone will make him safe, “and about the past” he quickly adds, “pray that the guilt of your transgressions may be pardoned.” But what good does such praying do for you if you do not become worthy to be heard by not yielding fruits worthy of repentance, so that you are not cut down like a barren tree and thrown into the fire? If you want to be heard when you pray for your sins, “Forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you.”\n"

This, in fact, is what the Lord promises to us with the words of the prophet, saying, “If you will be converted and weep, you will be saved.” Elsewhere it is also said, “My child, have you sinned? Sin no more, but ask forgiveness for your previous sins so that they may be forgiven.” Prayer for sins would not have been commanded of the sinner if forgiveness of sins would not have to be granted to the one praying. But penance is fruitful for the sinner if it takes place in the catholic church; to the church, God in the person of Peter granted the power to bind and to loose, saying, “Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” Therefore, at whatever age an individual makes true penance for his sins and corrects his life through the gift of illumination that God gives to him, he will not be deprived of the gift of forgiveness because God, as he asserts through the prophet, does not desire the death of one dying but rather that he be converted from his perverse way and that his soul live.\n"

Even the coarse Jews reject the insult of the letter in this passage. Some refer it to the greediness of the altar, meaning that it was built on Benjamin’s portion, since what is offered in the morning is divided in the evening by the priests. Others, with various stories, which are nonetheless fables, admit that these words can have no literal force. In the church, many hold the opinion that this passage refers to the apostle Paul. I do not reject or question this interpretation but try to do what is written: “Hearing a wise word, he praises it and adds another.” And thus to the explanation that my predecessors have validly referred to Paul and that I do not deny, I nevertheless add another. Benjamin, it says, means “son of sorrow.” By lot he obtained as his inheritance the place in which the earthly Jerusalem was located, which is the type and has the form of the heavenly. When, therefore, the time will come for the heavenly Jerusalem and the church of the firstborn enrolled in heaven to be manifest, this Jerusalem that at present has been cast out and driven away for its lack of faith, that for so long with its children has suffered hunger for the word of God and thirst for spiritual drink12—when the fullness of the Gentiles has been reached, according to the apostle’s promise, “then all Israel will be saved.”\n"

Let them return to the authority of the Gospel and find that man who lived in the tombs, possessed by the demons. When the Savior asks it, “What is your name?” it answers, “Legion, for we are many.” Why therefore does it seem strange to attribute a demon to a particular kind of sin, since it is written that in a single man an entire legion of demons was found? But I remember saying similar things when we were expounding that verse in the psalms where it says, “In the mornings I wiped out all the sinners on the earth in order to disperse from the city of the Lord all those who do iniquity.” Thus it is also said that “in the hand of the just there are swords that cut in two,” undoubtedly in order for them to destroy opposing powers. But I believe that, in order to bring even more force to these affirmations, we can cite the word of the apostle Paul: “May the God of peace swiftly grind Satan under your feet.” If, in fact, Satan is alone, can he be subjected under the feet of the servants of God and then take action again? If he has been subjected, and subjected by God, he surely can act no longer. Perhaps it will be necessary then to think that there are as many satans as there are those who complete his works. It seems to me that this is also what is indicated in the book of Wisdom26 where it is said, “The impious who curse Satan are cursing their own soul.” But we also find this kind of thinking in a booklet not even contained in the canon, entitled The Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, that individual satans ought to be recognized in individual sinners. The same idea seems to be expressed in a still more illuminating way when looking at the meaning of its name, according to the instruction of erudite Hebrews: Satan means “adversary.” All those, therefore, who oppose the will of God can be called satans.\n"

For this, in fact, is what the Lord says by means of the prophet: “Open your mouth, and I will fill it up.” This is also why another Scripture says, “Sting the eye, and it will bring forth a tear; sting the heart, and it will bring forth understanding.”\n"

But God’s whips are of a kind that to some of those who are whipped they cause pain but for others who are whipped, they do not. Let us see if we can explain what it means to suffer from the whips of God and what it means not to suffer: why those with evil natures do not suffer from the whips of God while those who do suffer from the whips of God are blessed. Wisdom says, “Who will apply whips to my thoughts and seals of prudence to my lips so that they2 would not spare me in my errors and so that my sins will not lead me to perdition?” Pay attention to the words “who will apply whips to my thoughts.” There are, therefore, whips that whip the thought. They are the whips of God that whip thought because the Word, joining itself to the soul and guiding it to the knowledge of its sins, whips it. It whips the blessed soul so that it suffers under its whips because the Word comes and penetrates the soul at its core, but it does not drive away the one who is reproved. But if someone is found to be insensitive to this whip, so to speak, it will be said of him, “You have whipped them, but they did not suffer.” Although the same word of accusation is pronounced in order to penetrate the mind of the one who has a spotted conscience5 from some sin, if one of the listeners suffers for this word to the point where it can be said of him, “You have seen that such a person was moved deeply” while another who hears does not suffer but remains insensitive to the one who is accusing him, surely of the insenstive one it will be said, “You have whipped them, but they have not suffered.”\n"

We remember the fish that we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the leeks, the garlic and the onions. Now, however,” they add, “our life has dried up, and we see nothing before us but this manna.” The sweet things are rejected, the bitter desired. A grave, debilitating illness leads the soul to want to take what is harmful and to despise and reject what is useful and good for salvation. Thus they refused the manna, that is, Christ, saying, “We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this one comes from.” Christ says in reproof, “If you believed Moses, you would also believe me, because it is of me that he wrote. Indeed, I am the living bread come down from heaven.” Did they not reject the holy manna when they said to Pilate, who wanted to release Jesus, “Release not him but Barabbas”? Barabbas was a notorious thief, and by asking for his release they professed to have in a certain sense desired, from among the thief’s crimes, the leeks, the onions and the garlic, those unpleasant Egyptian foods that make one cry. To those who murmured, in fact, the divine majesty offered meats that did not restore but instead ruined those who ate them. It says in Scripture, “The natural person does not understand the things of the Spirit: every sluggard lives in concupiscence.” It is right that the spiritual person asks that the desires of his flesh be taken from him. All these things show that it is wicked to desire and to ask of God things that are harmful to the soul, and especially to ask for them with murmuring. If a soul desires to enter the promised land, it must guard itself from offending God with such a desire.\n"

David, inspired by God, testifies, “By the Word of the Lord the heavens were fixed, and by the Spirit of his mouth all of their power.” See how rich his brief words are, and how he clearly returns to the mystery of unity: by “Lord” indicating the Father, indicating the Son with the term “Word” and designating the Holy Spirit with the expression “from the mouth of the Most High.” And so the term “Word” would not be understood as the emanation of the voice, he says that the heavens were fixed through him. And so the term “Spirit” would not be understood as breath, he showed in him the fullness of the power of heaven. In fact, where there is power, there must be a person. By saying “all” he means not a power taken from the Father or from the Son but a power perfect in the Holy Spirit, not in such a way that he alone would have that which is in the Father and in the Son, but that he would have it fully, together with them both.\n"

But the eternal life itself, of which we are made partakers, is one thing; we ourselves, who, by partaking of it, shall live eternally, are another. For if he had said, “Whom in his own time the Father will show, who is the blessed and only potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords; who only has immortality,” not even then would it be necessarily understood that the Son is excluded. For neither has the Son separated the Father from himself, because he himself, speaking elsewhere with the voice of wisdom (for he himself is the Wisdom of God), says, “I alone compassed the circuit of heaven.” And therefore it is even more unnecessary that the words “who has immortality” should be understood of the Father alone, omitting the Son, when they are said thus: “That you keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: whom in his own time he will show, who is the blessed and only potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords; who only has immortality, dwelling in the light that no one can approach; whom no one has seen or can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting.

Those pastures were savored by the one who sang to God, “How sweet are your words to my palate, more than honey in my mouth.” The same person refers to these pastures when addressing the sheep of the Lord: “Taste and see how sweet the Lord is.” Therefore, read the laws of the Decalogue of the Old Testament where they tell us “not to kill, not to steal, not to speak false testimony,” and those that follow. Read the New Testament’s praise of these commandments: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth,” and those that follow, and still many more transmitted from the prophets and the apostles. These are the pastures referred to when the Shepherd turns and exclaims to the sheep, “Work for food that does not perish.” It does not perish because the Word of God remains forever. The Word of the Lord is your food, indeed, not only food but also drink. Thus, through the prophet, he addresses the people of old: “However many partake of me will still be hungry, and however many drink of me will still have thirst.” And referring directly to himself he says the same thing: “My flesh is real food, my blood is real drink.” These pastures are found next to the water that recreates, and these pastures and water are found only in the catholic church. Here your pastures are found in the commandments of life, here is found the fountain of water that flows to eternal life. Those streams will renew you when you come to be baptized in order to be restored in Christ. This is the water that must water your pastures so that you can grow; only the baptism of Christ produces fruits from the commandments, and only these nourish us so that we may be satisfied.\n"

Pishon means “multitude,” since the river is formed from the confluence of ten large rivers. The Ganges received its name from king Gangaro of India. It is also said that it has floods like those of the Nile, inundating the lands of the East. The Tigris is a river of Mesopotamia that flows out of paradise and runs toward Assyria, and after many bends it empties into the Dead Sea. It received this name because of its velocity, which is like that beast called the tiger, which runs with great agility. The Euphrates is a river of Mesopotamia, full of gems, that springs from paradise and flows across Babylon. It receives its name from the harvests, that is, from its fruitfulness, since in Hebrew Euphrata means “fertility,” and it irrigates some parts of Mesopotamia like the Nile does Alexandria. Sallust, a very reliable author, says that the Tigris and the Euphrates rise at the same source in Armenia and, following separate courses, move away from each other leaving a space of many miles, and that the land they embrace is called Mesopotamia. The Jordan is a river of Judea that receives its name from two sources, one of which is called Ghor and the other Dan. These begin at a great distance from each other but then flow together into a single bed, called the Jordan from that point on. It begins at the feet of Mount Lebanon and separates Judea from Arabia, and after a sinuous course it flows into the Dead Sea. The Gihon River flows out of paradise and encircles all of Ethiopia. It was given this name because it irrigates the entire land of Egypt with its floods. Ge in Greek is the same as “earth” in Latin. The Egyptians call it the Nile for the silt that it carries and that causes fertility: for this reason the Nile is called Niam ciaon, and previously in Latin it was called Melo. It makes its appearance in the Nile lake, from which it enters Egypt from the south; there it encounters winds from the north that make the waters regress, swelling and flooding Egypt. The identification of the four rivers of paradise, which come from a single source, with the wisdom of the king born of David, indicates that the four Gospels proceed from our Lord Jesus Christ, true Son of God and also true Son of man, that is, of David, since he took flesh from David’s descendant. And the Gospels irrigate all the lands of the peoples with their preaching, so that Christ’s faithful might cause many fruits of virtue to germinate. The course of the Jordan also comes from the same source, since the sacrament of baptism has come into the world that the offenses of the human race might be purified by its administration. It sends forth discipline as light, since its precepts give the light of eternal life to those who follow it faithfully. For this reason, when Christ sent his disciples to teach and baptize the nations after his resurrection, he said to them in the Gospel, “Go therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. See, I am with you all days, to the end of the world.”\n"

But those others that the word disparaged at first since they were poor did not listen, the prophet says, they did not hear because they are poor, “I will go to the strong and I will speak to them,” and if it is true that the blessed are meant when it says “the ears of those who listen,” one is also blessed if he ever meets a strong and great listener. Therefore, after such things had been said in this way, knowing that with those who speak the damage is minor in comparison with those who although they listen do not receive admonition, seeing also that Jeremiah accused them of poverty of spirit and thoughts, let us ask to receive from God power and greatness as the word grows in us so that we are able to hear the sacred and holy words.\n"

A schemer does this, not a helper! “Woman,” it says, “was the beginning of sin, and because of her we all die.” And blessed Paul says, “Adam was not deceived. It was the woman who, being deceived, transgressed.” How, then, can she be a helper who put the man at the mercy of death? How could she be a helper who brought it about that the children of God, which is to say all of the inhabitants of the earth, are submerged in death together with the beasts, the birds and all the other animals? Would not the woman have caused the ruin of righteous Job, if he had not been truly a man? Was it not the woman who brought about Sampson’s ruin? Was it not a woman who did her best that the whole Hebrew people take up the worship of Baal of Peor and was slaughtered at the hands of her brothers? And who more than anyone else consigned Ahab to the devil, and before him Solomon, despite his wisdom and fame? Even now, do not women often lead their husbands to offend God? Did not the wise man say, perhaps for this reason, “Any kind of evil is small, compared with the evil of a woman”? “How is it then,” you ask me, “that God said, ‘Let us make a helper like him’? God does not lie.” Nor do I say so—never! She was made for that purpose and reason, but like her companion, she did not want to remain in the dignity that was hers. The man was created by God in his image and likeness. Indeed, God said, “Let us make the man in our image and likeness,” just as he said, “Let us make him a helper.” Once created however, the man immediately lost both of these prerogatives. He knew how to keep neither the image nor the likeness (and how could he have, if he gave himself over to absurd desire, was prey to deception and was unable to overcome pleasure?).

The scribes who condemned Jesus to death, their intelligence darkened and their minds blinded, were no longer able to see the meaning of the sacred text. All those who condemned Jesus to death were handed over to Christ’s enemy, death. Those who mocked him in turn became the object of mockery when “Jerusalem was surrounded by armies” and its desolation drew near. Those who scourged Jesus were themselves scourged and continue to be so, until “the fullness of the nations has come in.” In fact, “one who throws a rock in the air hits himself on the head.” And all of this happened so that God’s vigilance over them would cease and would be transferred to those who have been saved from among the nations, along with the “chosen remnant.” Indeed, “if the Lord of hosts had not left a remnant,” they would already be “like Sodom,” and they would have become like Gomorrah.\n"

Envious men, plotting a trick against the servant of God, convinced the king to command that for thirty days no prayer could be offered to a god or a person but only to the king, with the penalty that if someone transgressed the king’s order he would be thrown into the pit as food for the lions. Although he saw the posted decree, the prophet continued to pray to his Lord three times a day, as was his custom. They arrested him as a rebel and took him to the king, who, unable to save him from their envy, entrusted the prophet to his God, confessing that he only could save him from death, which is exactly what happened. In his distress, the king would not eat, taking neither food nor sleep, and at dawn he went in haste to see Daniel. Finding him alive and unhurt and glorifying the true God, he ordered Daniel to be taken from the pit and those who accused him to be thrown in instead, and they were immediately devoured in his presence. In these events also the prophecy was fulfilled: “One who digs a pit for his neighbor will fall into it. And one who lays a snare for his neighbor will perish in it.” And our Lord Jesus, in whom all of these figures appeared, says by the mouth of the prophet, “They have dug a pit before me and have fallen in it themselves,” and, “The Lord sent his mercy and his truth and has freed my life from the lions.”\n"

For this is love’s sign; God prefers love to all things. For as in making the royal purple, the flowers and dyes that make up the color of the robe are considered the most precious, so here too, those virtues are the most precious that preserve love. But nothing maintains love so much as when we do not remember those who have sinned against us. But why? Did he not guard the other side as well? Why? Did he not drive the one that has done the wrong to the person who is wronged? Does he not send him from the altar to go and meet the other person, and after the reconciliation then invite him to the table? But do not, therefore, wait for the other to come, since if you do so, you have lost everything. For to this intent most especially does he appoint to you an unspeakable reward, that you be the first to act before the other, since, if you are reconciled by his entreaties, the love is no longer the result of the divine command but of the other party’s diligence. This is why you go away uncrowned while he receives the rewards.What are you saying? Do you have an enemy and you are not ashamed? Why, isn’t the devil enough of an enemy for us that we have to bring on ourselves those of our own race as well? Would that not even he had been minded to wage war against us! Would that not even he were a devil! Don’t you know how great the pleasure is after reconciliation? For it does not appear great at all when we are at enmity. But it is sweeter to love someone who does us wrong than to hate him. That is what we learn after the enmity is done away with. Why then do we imitate the mad, devouring one another, warring against our own flesh? Hear even under the Old Testament how great regard there was for this: “The ways of vengeful people lead to death.” One person keeps his anger against another, and does he seek the healing of God? And yet God allowed an “eye for an eye” and a “tooth for a tooth,” so how then does he find fault?” Because he allowed even those things, not that we should do them to one another, but so that through the fear of suffering we might abstain from the commission of a crime. And besides, those acts are the fruits of a short-lived anger, but to remember injuries is the part of a soul that exercises itself in evil. But have you suffered evil? And yet, it was nothing so great as you will do to yourself by remembering injuries.\n"

For someone who is not eternal must surely abandon this world, even if by force. Therefore by continually remembering one’s mortality the individual learns to do good according to his own free will.

For this reason the apostle Paul exhorted Timothy with these words: “Avoid vain discussions, which are good for nothing but the destruction of those who listen.” And, “Avoid foolish and ignorant debates, knowing that they breed quarrels.

For how much swelling and what great agony arises from the wounded spot? But now, if it happens that someone is repeatedly wounded in the same place or the same bone is broken more than once, by what tremendous pain and agony can this be healed and cured? And by what length of time is this brought to healing, if indeed it is even possible? And scarcely ever will one be cured in such a way that he avoids a physical infirmity or a nasty scar.Pass now from the example of the body to the wounds of the soul. However often the soul sins, just that often it is wounded. And lest you be in doubt that it is wounded by sins, as if by arrows and swords, listen to the apostle when he admonishes us to take up “the shield of faith by which,” he says, “you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.” So you see that sins are the “arrows of the evil one,” which are aimed at the soul. But not only does the soul suffer the wounds of arrows, but it also experiences fractures of its feet when “snares are prepared for its feet” and when its “steps are made to trip.” So, by what length of time do you think that these wounds and others like them can be cured? O, if we could only see how with each sin our inner person is wounded, how bad words inflict a wound! Have you not read, they say, that “swords inflict wounds, but not as much as the tongue.” The soul is wounded, then, even by the tongue; it is also wounded by evil thoughts and desires; but it is fractured and shattered by the works of sin. If we could see all this and feel the scars of a soul that has been wounded, we would certainly resist sin to death. But now, just as those who are filled with a demon or the mentally insane do not perceive it when they are wounded, because they lack natural senses, so is it with us. Since we have become crazed by the desires of the world7 or intoxicated with vices, we cannot feel the extent of the wounds or the extent of the grief we are bringing on our soul by sinning. And therefore it is perfectly consistent that the reckoning of the punishment, that is, of the medical treatment and cure, is extended over time and that for each wound the length of healing be prolonged as well, according to the nature of the wound.\nSo then, the justice and kindness of God will also become evident in those very penalties of the soul. Let the one who hears this and has committed sin come to his senses and sin no more. For conversion in the present life and a penance having been carried out fruitfully will bring swift medicine to wounds of this sort, since penance not only heals a past wound, but it does not allow the soul to be wounded further by sin.\n"

What I am saying to you, by God’s permission, is an audacious thing. For the great mediator Jesus, Son of the blessed Father, distributor of the holy and life-giving Spirit says to you through me, who am least of all, “Your many sins are forgiven you,” from birth up until this very minute. In receiving this great and inexpressible joy, you then love him with all your might, displaying fruit worthy of repentance, proclaiming with Saint Paul those melodious words, “Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress, or hunger, or persecution, or nakedness, or danger, or fear or the sword?” And again, “Because of you we are being put to death all day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughterhouse. But in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. I am confident that neither death, nor life, neither angels, nor principalities, nor authorities, nor things present or things future, neither powers, nor height, nor depth nor anything else in all of creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” Make sure you not only meditate on these things in what you say but also in what you do. For Jesus says, “By your patience your soul is acquired.” You have become worthy of a great dignity: perform great and worthy works of patience and thanksgiving through which come the expectation of perfection, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Think about these things continually and conscientiously, and you will taste their sweetness, as they become fragrant to your soul and the souls of those who are able to choose them.\n"

This is how they conducted themselves, because if they had not, their lives that were otherwise suited to holiness would have remained sterile, limiting themselves to abstaining from sins, not violating chastity or abandoning themselves to drunkenness, not stealing or doing anything bad. If they had not added charitable actions, they would remain sterile, only observing the first part of the commandment, “Stay far away from evil,” and not the other part, “and do good.” Thus, when it says, “Come, receive your kingdom,” this call is not motivated by the fact that they have lived in chastity, refrained from stealing, or that they have not taken advantage of the poor, or robbed other people’s possessions or perjured themselves. Rather, it says, “Because I was hungry and you gave me something to eat.” This fact is recognized as all the more important if the Lord was silent about the rest and only focused on this merit. In an analogous way, when he says to others, “Go into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels,” he does not introduce any of the other causes that could have been adduced for their sentences because they were adulterers, murderers, liars, sacrilegious, blasphemers, unbelievers; instead he only says, “I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat.” I see that this has made an impression on you and astonishes you; this is truly amazing what he is saying. I will try to sort out for you the meaning and communicate it to you. It is written, “As water extinguishes a blazing fire, so aid given to the poor cancels one’s sins.” And still, “Visit mercy on the heart of the poor, and the same will pray to the Lord for you.” We have already cited the passage, “Listen, my king, and redeem your sins with mercy.” These are some of the many passages from the Word of God that demonstrate the importance of mercy in order to extinguish and to cancel sins. Or, there are also those whom the Lord condemns—or no, rather, those whom he is going to reward with crowns, as we have heard, for their acts of charity, as though he were saying, It would be difficult when weighing and examining carefully your actions to find a reason not to condemn you. Instead, he says, “Enter into the kingdom because I was hungry and you gave me something to eat.” Therefore, they will be saved, not because they have not sinned but because they have redeemed their sins with their good works.\n"

Indeed, it is written, “One who loves money will not be satisfied by money.” Nor does one love God who does not pity the poor, in whom Christ asks us to recognize that he is either helped or neglected. “When you did not do this to one of these least,” he says, “you did not do it to me.” And the apostle John says in his epistle, “If someone sees his brother or sister in need and closes his heart to them, the love of God is not in him.” One falsely says that he loves Christ if he does not love the poor person, if he denies in his actions the love that he professes with his words. Let everyone therefore make an effort to give proof by their actions that they love God, because the love of God will purify them from all sin. Do you want, then, to know to what a great extent alms lighten the weight of sins? Listen to the counsel the prophet Daniel offers to the rich sinner: “Now, O king,” he said, “may my advice please you: redeem your evil actions with alms and your sins with acts of mercy to the poor.” But perhaps you are thinking of keeping for yourself and your children what you do not want to give to the poor? I do not want you to worry yourself so dangerously, since “you do not know what tomorrow will bring.” Our God is powerful enough to give to them and to you. Indeed, everything that you give to the poor as alms you have put to your account and to that of your children. Nothing can be lacking to those whom you have joined to Christ. The one who assures us that he receives through the poor knows how to repay. Give without worries. He is a trustworthy borrower, the one who promises the kingdom of heaven. The divine Scripture says, “Hide your alms in the bosom of the poor person, and he will pray to God for you.” It is as though it said, “Sell your inheritance and acquire a surety, by which you can look with an unveiled face18 on the judge who is coming, certain of having obtained pardon.” Then in the Gospel it says, “If you want to be perfect, sell what you have, give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me.”\n"

Even if you fall in battle, you will have lived. If, in earthly wars, one who is ready to be killed is held in more esteem than the others and is more invincible and fearsome to the enemy—even if, after his death, the king for whom he has taken up arms cannot bring him back to life—how much more in these battles, with such a great hope of resurrection, will the one who exposes his life to death find it, first because he will not be taken quickly, and second, because even if he falls, it will bring him to a higher life.\n"

The Scripture also criticized this practice when, speaking about those who do not recognize the good things they have, it says, “As though making offerings of food at a grave.” It is obvious that this can be of no use to the one who is dead. It is in fact a pagan custom and not part of the tradition that conforms to the truth of the Patriarchs. Of them, one reads that they did solemnly celebrate the funeral rites but not that they carried sacrificial offerings to the tombs.

You think that the veins of gold in the mines or the gold in palaces could be yours. In fact, even if you had that pile of wealth, you would only hoard it. It would not serve you, because if you do not make use even now of your goods, not touching them as though they belonged to someone else, how much more would you do so if you had more? Usually, for the avaricious, the more abundant the wealth they surround themselves with, the more they save. “But,” you could reply, “I know that it’s mine.” In that case, the possession is only in your thoughts and not in enjoyment. But, you could object, I will be formidable before others. Actually, you would be more vulnerable before the rich, the poor, thieves, calumniators, servants—in effect, before all those who might plot against you. If you want to be formidable, eliminate the occasions by which all those who do this kind of thing might take advantage of and harm you. Have you never heard the proverb that says that not even a hundred people together could ever despoil a poor, naked person? In fact, he has the greatest defender, poverty, one that not even the king could subjugate and conquer. Instead, all these things create anguish for the avaricious person. And why speak of people, given that moths and worms war against such an individual? But why even speak of moths? A long period of time is sufficient, even with no one to bother them, for riches to undergo major damage. What, therefore, is the pleasure of riches? I see the unpleasant aspects, whereas you speak to me of the pleasure you derive from them. What, you might reply, are the unpleasant aspects? Worries, plots, hostilities, hatred, fear, endless thirst after riches and anxiety over them. If someone embraces the girl he loves but cannot satisfy his desire, he suffers an even greater torment. This also happens to the rich person. He certainly has riches and is with them, but he cannot satisfy all his desire. The same happens with all rich people as what is spoken of by a wise man: “Like the desire of a eunuch to deflower a maiden,” and, “Like a eunuch who embraces a virgin and groans.”\n"

For this reason, the greater their power appears outwardly to others, the more superiors must not cease to ensure that they inwardly keep it under control. They cannot let it overcome their thoughts or let their hearts be carried away by its delights, lest the mind prove unable to control the very thing it submits itself to, due to a lust for domination. In fact, so that the heart of the superior not be carried away to the point of exaltation over pleasure in his power, a wise man rightly said, “They have made you a leader. Do not exalt yourself but be among them as one of them.” For this reason Peter also says, “Not as masters over those assigned to you, but be an example to the flock.” The Truth, therefore, inviting us to the highest merits of virtue, says, “Know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are greater make their power felt. It shall not be this way among you, but the one who wants to be the greatest will be your servant, and the one who wants to be first among you will be your slave—like the Son of man, who did not come to be served but to serve.” This is the meaning of the words referring to that servant who was exalted by the power he had received, but afterward punishments await him, “And if that wicked servant says in his heart, ‘My master is delayed in coming,’ and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with drunkards, then the master of that servant will come on a day that he does not expect and an hour he does not know, and he will cut him off, and his fate will be that of the hypocrites.

In fact, the one whom the Lord loves, he corrects, and he always scourges the one he accepts,” whereas “the sinner shuns reproof.” Therefore “let the just one accuse me,” says the Scripture, “and correct me, but let not the oil of sinners anoint my head.”\n"

And what are the clouds, which are moved by the wind, if not the hostility of evil people? Clearly, the clouds are blown by the wind because evil people are excited by the breath of unclean spirits. Consequently, the one who pays attention to the wind will not sow, and one who watches the clouds will never reap, because the one who fears the temptation of evil spirits and the persecution of human beings will neither sow the grain of good works nor cut the sheaves of holy retribution. The precipitous, who anticipate the time for good actions, pervert their merit and frequently fall into evil, because they have no discernment of the good. They do not inquire into what would be the right moment to do something but for the most part only think of this once they have done it, with an awareness that it should have been done differently. To these, under the guise of speaking to a pupil, Solomon says, “Do nothing without counsel, and after you have done it you will not regret it.” And further, “Let your eyelids precede your steps.” Our eyelids precede our steps when good counsel precedes our action. The one who neglects to consider in advance what he expects to do straightens his steps, closes his eyes and arrives at the end of his way but does not precede his steps with foresight. Consequently, he more quickly stumbles, because he does not pay attention, with the eyelids of counsel, to where to plant the foot of his works.\n"

And third, he would have continued to sin for all eternity. But God kept all this far from the man by casting him out of paradise. In the same way a doctor who ignores a wound produces a worse inflammation. But if he resorts to an incision, he prevents the infection from spreading. Nor did God stop there, but he also added sweat and toil, because it is the nature of human beings to not be made for relaxation. And if, though being inflicted with these punishments, we persist in sin, what would we have not dared to do if God had moved us toward softness and idleness? “Idleness teaches many evils,” it is said. Both what happens every day and the things that happened to those who came before us testify to this.

Sometimes, in fact, dreams are caused by bad digestion or by fasting, at times they are the fruit of an illusion, at other times of reflection and illusion together, at still other times of revelation, and, finally, at times of reflection and revelation together. Everyone experiences the first two types. The other four, rather, we find in the pages of sacred Scripture. If, in fact, dreams were not for the most part provoked by the hidden enemy through an illusion, the wise man would not have put us on guard, saying, “Dreams have led many into error, and those who put their hope in them have gone astray.” Nor would he exhort us, “Do not practice any sort of divination or magic.” These words show unequivocally how one must flee from everything having anything to do with the divining arts. Furthermore, if dreams did not at times proceed from reflection joined to illusion, the wise man would never had said, “From many cares come dreams.” And if, at times, the mystery of a revelation did not give origin to dreams, Joseph would not have been revered by his brothers in a dream, nor would an angel have said to the husband of Mary in a dream to take the baby and flee to Egypt. Moreover, if dreams did not proceed from reflection together with a revelation, the prophet Daniel, when he interpreted the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, would not have begun by referring to a reflection, saying, “O king, the thoughts that came to you while you were in bed concern the future. He who reveals mysteries wanted to reveal to you what will take place.” And then, “As you watched, O king, you saw a statue, an enormous statue of extraordinary splendor, rising before you with a terrifying appearance.” Thus Daniel, while he cautiously allows it to be understood that the dream will become reality and shows from what reflection it was produced, clearly shows that at times a dream is born simultaneously from reflection and from a revelation. Clearly, precisely because dreams have such different characteristics and origins, the more difficult it is to discern what their source is, the less should one be inclined to put faith in them. The saints, however, by a special sensibility they possess, are able to distinguish between illusions and revelations and to penetrate the meaning of the words and images in visions. Thus they know either what they have received from the good spirit or what illusion they have been victimized by. But if a soul is not prudent regarding dreams, it will find itself lost in a forest of vanity through the work of the deceiving spirit, whose art it is at times to predict many true things, so as to then imprison the soul in the snare of a single lie.\n"

Why does he say elsewhere, “The person who has not been tempted is not proven,” and again, “Consider it supreme joy, brothers and sisters, when you fall into various temptations.” But to enter into temptation is not to let oneself be overwhelmed by temptation. In fact, temptation seems like a stream of difficult passage. Some, who do not let themselves be submerged by temptation, make it across. They are good swimmers who do not allow themselves to be carried away by the stream. Others, who are not good swimmers, are submerged when they enter the stream. Thus, for example, Judas, having entered into the temptation of avarice, did not overcome it but hanged himself, being materially and spiritually submerged. Peter entered into the temptation of denial6 but, overcoming it, was not submerged by it. He crossed the stream with courage and was not carried away. In yet another passage, listen to the chorus of the perfect saints, who give thanks for having escaped temptation. “You tried us, O God. Like silver you passed us through the fire. You pushed us into the snare, you laid sufferings on our backs. You made people pass over our heads. We passed through fire and water, and you have brought us to refreshment.”\n"

The occasion for stealing is removed, therefore, if the limits of the right of possession are clearly established beforehand. Only those who have been admonished in this way should then hear how they should mercifully distribute what they possess. That is, when they have learned to not mix the good of mercy with the wickedness of theft, since they will later seek, with violence, what they had earlier bestowed in mercy. It is one thing to be merciful toward sins and another to sin so as to be merciful—which, besides, can no longer be called mercy, because the tree that has become bitter cannot yield sweet fruit, due to the poison of a diseased root. For this reason the Lord reproves the sacrifices themselves through the prophet, saying, “I the Lord love justice and hate thievery in sacrifices.” He also says, “The sacrifices of the impious are an abomination, issuing from crimes.” This is because they often take what they offer to God from the poor. But the Lord shows with what blame he rejects them, saying through a wise man, “One sacrifices a son before his own father who offers a sacrifice with the goods of the poor.” What could be more unbearable than the death of a son before his father’s eyes? In this way it shows the wrath with which this sacrifice is regarded, which is compared with the sorrow of a father deprived of his son. And yet, they frequently weigh up what they give but fail to consider what they steal. They count what they give as though it were wages due but refuse to attentively weigh their wrongs. Listen, then, to what is written: “The one who gathered wages put them in a sack with a hole in it,” since one sees when he puts the money into such a sack, but he does not see when he loses it.\n"

The sinner, moreover, if he does make a bit of effort, also has need of the prayers of the righteous. As the apostle says, “The intense prayer of the righteous can do much.” This happens when a holy and righteous person intercedes and the sinner cooperates with the saints’ prayers, to the extent possible for him, by penance, being unable to pay his debt by himself. His contribution is small, but that of the prayer of the saints is great. It is as though someone needed to carry ten sacks of grain and was unable to carry even two but finds a God-fearing person who takes nine of them, leaving him with just one. And he is protected in this way until he arrives safe and sound, unharmed by robbers. This also is the same thing.\n"

Indeed, not in vain did the Word of God unite both these elements, that we might know that both are necessary, conversion and groaning, to attain salvation. Some, in fact, humiliated by the consideration of their offenses, groan in prayer over their iniquities, but, this notwithstanding, they do not distance themselves from their bad actions. They recognize they have behaved badly but do not want to put an end to their wicked actions. They humbly denounce before God the sins that oppress them but obstinately pile up in their perverse heart the same sins they denounce with their humble speech. The indulgence that they ask for with tearful groanings, they take away by their bad actions. They ask the doctor for medicine and give sustenance to the sickness, to their ruin. And thus vainly they seek by their words to placate the just judge, who they incite to greater fury by wicked actions. Such people will never purify their sins with groanings, because they do not stop sinning after their groaning. They groan for their misdeeds, and after they groan, they return to them. In Ecclesiasticus, the sacred Scripture speaks of such persons thusly: “The one who purifies himself after having touched a dead person and touches him again, what good did it do him to have been purified? Likewise, the person who fasts for his sins and again does the same actions, what advantage does he gain from humiliating himself? Who will listen to his prayers?” Fine, says God to such a person, “If you convert and groan, you will be saved.” With the severe and good God, when one has turned to God with the humility of a contrite heart, then the prayer of the one who groans will be heard, the request made with tears will be attended to, salvation will be granted to the one who weeps. Certainly God will pardon the sinner and have mercy on him if the sinner acknowledges his iniquity by conversion.\n"

In fact, those who “go out weeping, scattering their seeds, will return rejoicing, carrying their sheaves.” How wisely the holy prophet teaches that the seeds of good works must be watered with rivers of tears! Indeed, no seed germinates without being watered. Nor does a seed bear fruit if it has been without the benefit of water.

Thus also in their blessings it is said that if they observe the law of the Lord, one of them will pursue a thousand, and two will cause ten thousand to flee. See, then, that a single saint who prays is worth much more than innumerable sinners in battle. “The prayer of the Holy One pierces heaven.” How will it not also defeat earthly enemies? For this reason, in every way you must make an effort to “seek” first and to preserve “the righteousness of God.” If you attain it and keep it, it will subject all of your enemies to you: if, as the apostle says, you are “clothed with the breastplate of righteousness and the belt of truth, if you take up the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit” and, above all, the “shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the evil one.” Equipped with these weapons, you will put to flight all of the camps of the devil and his whole army, and you will faithfully sing, “If they encamp against me, my heart will not fear.

The Lord fills them with his unspeakable words and instructs them with knowledge of the divine books, in which are proclaimed the inexpressible power of God and the incomparable glory of his majesty. Moreover, by the signs of miracles he manifests his power among all peoples, so that, for this reason, it will be a motive for terror and for honor among all the surrounding nations. Thus we read in the Acts of the Apostles that while Paul preached and performed miracles in the city of Ephesus, “all were filled with fear,” that is, the Jews and the Gentiles who lived there, “and they glorified the name of the Lord Jesus. Many who had embraced the faith came to confess their actions in public. And many who had followed magic arts brought their books and burned them before all. The value of all of these was calculated, and they found it to be fifty thousand drachmas of silver. In this way the word of God grew and was strengthened.”\n"

In fact, the arts of debate and calculation are not referred to the senses of the body but to the rational faculty of the soul. Through these arts the truth is piously sought by those who fear God, who find it with profit, but the art of debate is useful for deepening and resolving every sort of question found in the holy Scriptures. One must merely avoid the desire to argue and the puerile ostentation of deceiving one’s adversary. There are many arguments called sophisms, that is, deductions based on false reasoning, that so closely imitate true reasoning that they deceive not only the obtuse but also those who, gifted with intelligence, do not give them the necessary attention. Someone, for example, says to another, “You are not what I am.” And he responds that he agrees (which is in part true). But since the one was treacherous and the other a simpleton, the first added, “I am a man.” And when the second said that he agreed, the first added, “Then you are not a man.” I think that the Scripture condemns this kind of captious conclusion when it says, “One who has recourse to sophisms in discourse is hated,” but also discourse that, though not being deceptive, is contorted by making use of more twists and turns of words than is appropriate to seriousness. This way of speaking by sophisms is characteristic of heretics, who do everything so as to seduce others with captiousness and malice. They are detestable to God and to all virtuous people.\n"

And the mystery of this event is obvious. The people grumble, seeing the waters and being unable to drink. Moses throws the wood into the waters, and they become sweet. Understand that the bitter waters represent the letter that kills and the Law. If one throws on this the confession of the cross and adds the mystery of the passion of the Lord, then the bitter water becomes sweet, and the bitterness of the letter is transformed into the sweetness of spiritual knowledge. For this reason it is written, “The Lord established a law and judgments for his people, and he tested them.” According to another sense, the bitter waters that become sweet by receiving the wood are an image of the bitterness of the nations over the wood of the cross of Christ, which at a certain point is destined to become sweet.\n"

In fact, the sacred Scripture shows that your behavior is also pleasing to God when it says, “Shed tears over the dead. As one who suffers grievously, begin the lament, and do not neglect his tomb.” Our patriarchs are also examples of the performance of this ritual. Abraham, the father of our faith, wept over Sarah, the mother of our vocation, not because he doubted ever seeing her again but out of sorrow for having lost her. How could the father of our faith have had doubts about the resurrection, he who was the first to hear the divine promise? Mindful of her human condition, however, he did not despise care for the body in view of eternal salvation, but after acquiring a field suited for the burial, he interred his dead wife in an honorable grave. In this way he wanted to show what people should do for the dying, since he, immediately after leaving the land of his ancestors at the call of God, and though acquiring no land among the fertile plots of the various countries, nevertheless wanted to buy—he, the pilgrim of every nation—a small fistful of dirt for the burial, that is, a perennial and permanent possession, a field not for profit but for eternal rest. Jacob also honored his beloved and awaited Rachel, not only with a famous mausoleum but also with an epitaph that was a religious comfort in his suffering and at the same time a testimony to posterity. Although he marked that grave with a mournful epitaph about his dead wife, with a prophetic spirit he foresaw that whereas the law was passing away, the gospel was coming into force. In the folds of this mystery, in many places the wife of the patriarch represented the image of the church. Nevertheless, as I believe, she dies as a symbol of the synagogue and in her delivery generates the son of pain, whereas the Virgin, also by childbirth, generates the end of the law: the end of the law is Christ. Tobias also suggests to us a holy and sanctified hope through his care for burial, and in a special way he was justified by the Lord for taking the initiative in this task, and indeed he was praised by the word of the archangel because he preferred the burial of a poor person to his own nourishment. Ignoring his stomach because he was famished in soul, he preferred to die of bodily hunger than of spiritual, so that he would be an example to us to prefer physical fasting at any cost, so as to secure for ourselves the salvation of our souls. See the goodness of care for the dead, see the goodness of the tears of love with which father Abraham desired to bury the mother of the ancient promises. Good also were the pious tears that Joseph the righteous shed for his dead father12 and the prayerful tears with which David bathed his bed almost every night. But why recall the grief of the holy patriarchs? Jesus mourned his friend, condescending to assume even this passion of our human condition, to the point of shedding tears for the dead and acting like a weak human person toward him whom he was going to raise by divine power. In that single man, however, the merciful and compassionate Lord also grieved over the condition of the human race, and in those tears with which he grieved our sins, he also cleansed them.\n"

This is why this potter works, turning the wheel with his feet, transforming the changeable situations of this life into an example for his disciples through the signs of good works. He watches what he does so that he might persevere in good actions, and by his own actions he invigorates the activity of the sick, giving them an example of humility and meekness and setting his whole heart on the smoothing of all that is bitter in the habits of those under him by the sweetness of his example. In addition, he spends all of his solicitude cooking every action of the disciples in the fire of the furnace of the heart, so as to render them firmer by the flame of love.

Elsewhere in a prophet, it is written, “Do I not fill heaven and earth?” God declares the reason why he fills all things: “Because I am with you to save you.” And with these words the Lord makes us understand not only that he governs and fills the universe but also the power and fruits of his presence. The divine presence, of itself, produces this fruit: the salvation of what it fills. And this is why saint Paul says in the Acts of the Apostles, “In him we have life, movement and being.”\n"

This almost always happens, and yet one is not always speaking of the confession of sins. At times, in fact, one speaks of the confession of praise, as in that passage of Scripture where it says, “Confess to the Lord, and in your confession you will say, ‘All the works of the Lord are very good.’ ” When you hear, “In your confession you will say, ‘All the works of the Lord are very good,’ ” it is clear that this is a confession of praise to God and not of your guilt. In this case, you confess that all the works of the Lord are good, not that your actions are bad. And here is another passage about which, as with the previous one, there can be no doubt. The Lord Jesus certainly committed no sin, yet in the Gospel it says, “I confess to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth.” And he continues with praise: “Because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to the little ones. Yes, Father, because that is what it pleased you to do.” This is the confession of one who praises God, not of one who accuses himself. Since, therefore, one who confesses either accuses himself or praises God, you should reflect a bit about the advantages of each type of confession.\n"

It is very well said that they roll, thus in some way indicating the agility and velocity with which they move toward every aspect of holiness. Round or spherical stones, in fact, overcome any obstacle and move with great facility, if one wants to move them. The mind of the saints, in turn, willingly adapts to the will of God. Since we are such “stones,” it is clear that we should be righteous and blameless. But if there is some good, it is his, if there is something beautiful, it comes from him, because God lavishes on us everything related to piety. What things? “Grain for the youths, sweet-smelling wine to the virgins.” One who … is disposed to follow God’s will with youthful boldness, wanting to do good, will receive from him even greater strength, symbolized by grain, since “bread strengthens the heart.” Another, who has been purified and has a pure mind and may justly be compared with the venerable and holy virgins, will receive like intelligible wine the clear and secure knowledge of God “that gladdens hearts.” Young people and virgins, therefore, as we have just explained, will rightly be called to participate to a high degree in the goods of heaven, and they will hear God say, “Eat and drink, become inebriated, you who are near me.” These are close to God, not with respect to place—it is stupid to think or imagine this—but in relation to an incontestable firmness of intellect and the aspiration to every virtue and to love for Him.\n"

Do you no longer feel the need for food? Do not allow the memory of the Benefactor to fade! If you put on your tunic, give thanks to him who gave it to you. If you wrap yourself in your cloak, let your love for God grow, who has given you suitable clothing in both winter and summer, to care for your life and to cover what is shameful. Has the day ended? Give thanks to him who lavished sunlight in service of the affairs of the day and fire to illuminate the night, for dealing with what is left to be done.\n"

You might find in such a condition those who, so to speak, beg for saving remedies from the Greeks or from the barbarians who promise truth; they lack a dignified means, suitable for a being endowed with logos, of procuring without danger the abundant contemplation of the truth. But the Logos forbids this manner of seeking, saying somewhere, “Do not lead the life of a beggar. It is better to die than to beg.” The unfaithful administrator in the Gospel was ashamed to beg, and therefore he says to the one who owes a hundred measures of wheat, “Take your note and write fifty,” and to the one who owes a hundred barrels of oil, “Take your note and write eighty,” preferring to decrease what is owed to his master than to shamefully beg, and for this he is praised. Jesus, therefore, not only freed the blind man of the blindness that had afflicted him from birth but also from begging, because together with his sight he also gave him the possibility of finding a way to procure for himself what was necessary for the salvation of his soul. In this case, the reason for begging was blindness, whereas in the Acts it was being lame: 6 one who is freed from these things will no longer beg.\n"

When it first appears, it could in fact seem to be something of little account, whereas in reality it has a truly great power. It gives us light from its rising in the east until it sets in the west. When the psalmist says that it rises in the morning “like a bridegroom from his chamber,” he gives an image of its temperate rays that do not bother the eyes at its rising, because at its appearance “like a bridegroom,” we find it pleasant. Only when it directs its horses2 toward midday do we for the most part shelter ourselves from its burning rays. Note above all how it regulates itself, although it is not the sun itself that appoints the rule but him who gave it its course to follow. In the summer, rising, it lengthens the days so as to give people more time for work. In the winter, it shortens its course, not so as to lengthen the time of cold but so that, the nights being longer, it would cooperate with human beings, promoting their rest, and with the earth to make it fruitful. Note also the harmony with which the days balance each other. In the winter they are shorter and in the summer longer, in spring and autumn they accord with one other, seeking a similar length. The night is regulated in the same way. As the psalmist says, “One day to the next hands on the message, and night to night transmits the news.” Day and night, with their orderly procession, cry out in unison to heretics that there is no other God than the Creator of all things, who has given them rule and order.\n"

Moreover, Christ remains before the moon, that is, before the church, which gazes on him always with the light of the heart. It is right to compare the moon with the church, since it does not have a splendor of its own but receives light from the sun in certain ways that astronomers accurately explain, along with other things. In the same way, the church is apportioned light from the true Creator. In time of persecution, the light diminishes.

They have without a doubt cooled in their love for him and have become cold. Indeed, the Lord says that “increasing iniquity, the love of many will grow cold.” And all those beings that symbolize the contrary power in sacred Scripture are always cold. The devil, in fact, is called a serpent and a dragon: what is colder than these? It is said that the dragon rules in the waters, and this is also said of one of the evil spirits that the prophet says dwells in the sea. And elsewhere the prophet says, “He will strike with the holy sword the serpent dragon that flees—the dragon, the perverse serpent—and he will kill him.” And in another passage, “Even if they depart from before my eyes and flee into the depths of the sea, I will command the dragon, and he will bite them.” And in Job this creature is called king of all the beings that are in the water.

One also notes that Abraham represents in himself three things. In the first place, the Savior, who, leaving his family, came into this world. Second, the Father, when he sacrificed his only Son. Third, by the fact that he had welcomed three men and adored one of them, he symbolized the saints, who joyfully received the coming of Christ in the flesh. This mystery of the incarnation is the work of the entire holy Trinity but was realized only in the Son. “And the Word was made flesh and came to dwell among us.”\n"

Moses wrote the book of Genesis, in which we read of Abraham and of those born to him, of whom many are righteous but none of whom merited to be called Jesus.

Moses was faithful in all his house, but not even he was called Jesus. Rather, I find the name of Jesus for the first time in the book of Exodus. I want to reiterate when the name of Joshua-Jesus is first mentioned, “Amalek came to fight against Israel, and Moses said to Joshua at Rephidim.” This is the first mention of the name Joshua-Jesus: “Choose some brave men from among the sons of Israel to fight against Amalek tomorrow.” He is the one who was given command after the death of Moses, who led the army and fought against Amalek and, as is symbolized by the hands stretched out on the mountain, nailed the principalities and powers to his victorious cross.\n"

This is therefore what he says, the one who is vigorous now under Jesus as he was vigorous then under Moses, since a vigilant heart remains vigorous in the mysteries of both Testaments. But we also see the request made by the same Caleb, son of Jephunneh, to Joshua: “Give me this mountain, of which the Lord spoke in that day.” The saint asks for nothing earthly or lowly, nothing that lies in the deep valleys, but asks for a very high mountain, a mountain on which there is a great, fortified city. He asks for it because he knew how to fight, as it is written, “The wise man storms a city of warriors and breaks down the stronghold in which it trusted.” Hearing these words of Solomon, do you think his intent was to teach us that the wise man had taken a city and destroyed fortresses made of stone? Or rather, does he indicate that the cities and walls are the dogmas of the godless and the syllogisms of the philosophers by which they compose impiety and what is opposed to the divine law, as practiced by the pagans and barbarians? But it must be assumed that the fortified cities set on the mountains are those things that heretics base on the statements of the Scriptures, as on high mountains. The wise man will therefore destroy the cities, preaching the word of truth and overthrowing the lying fortresses with the battering ram of truth, as Paul also said: “Destroying arguments and every bulwark that raises itself against the knowledge of God.”\n"

And yet the lamb does not take on himself the sins of all, if they do not suffer and experience torment until their sins are taken from them. There are in fact thorns that are not merely loose but firmly stuck in the hands of whoever is so drunk with vice as to even forget the state of sobriety, as it says in Proverbs, “Thorns are hidden in the hands of a drunkard.” Must we spend words describing what troubles such implanted evils cause to the one who accepts them in the body of his soul? One who has accepted moral evil so deeply in his soul as to become a land that produces thorns4 needs to be deeply cut by the living Logos of God, which is “effective and sharper than any two-edged sword,” hotter than any fire. Into a soul reduced to this state, that fire must be sent that is capable of finding the thorns6 and getting at them in virtue of its divinity, without setting fire to the stems and ears of the fields. Many are the ways in which the Lamb of God takes away the sins of the world, in the first place through the sacrifice of himself.

Elijah, then, gives the occasion to ask, because in the Gospel it says, “Ask, and it will be given you.” And also, “Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.” Having received this assurance from the Lord, Elisha, that is, the Christian people, asks that the spirit of Christ be doubled in him, which is to say, a double grace of the Holy Spirit, for the remission of sins and for the conferral of virtue. Our Redeemer, who had no sin, and neither did he commit sin, nor was deception found in his mouth, had no need for the remission of sins, not having any sin, but carried out the works of the Holy Spirit.

Of him John says, “His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor.”\n"

He is told, therefore, what will happen at the end, that this world will pass away4 and that he will destroy every principality, power and might, pull down the thrones of kings and destroy the power of kingdoms and nations, and the chariots, the horses and the riders. “In that day, says the Lord of hosts, I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, my servant.” He calls him “servant” because of the human body, since “then he also, the Son, will be subjected to the one who subjected all things to him,” and with all things subjected it will be seen that he also is subjected. But when all of this is fulfilled, God will put a seal in his hands. God the Father marks him, and he is the image of the invisible God, his imprint and his substance, and whoever will believe in God will be sealed as with a ring.\n"

Peter also makes the trumpets resound in his two epistles, as do James and Jude. John continues to sound the trumpet in his epistles, as does Luke when he describes the deeds of the apostles. And finally the one arrives who says, “I believe that God has placed us, the apostles, in the last place,” and hurling lightning bolts with the trumpets of his fourteen epistles, he makes the walls of Jericho—the contrivances of idolatry and the opinions of philosophers—collapse on their foundations.\n"

One of these is the Jewish people subject to the letter of the law, which was also known by the name of Seir, which means “shaggy” or “hairy.” Seir is Esau, whose name means “red,” the older son of Isaac and Rebecca; the younger was called Jacob. But why was Esau all red and hairy, if not because the first people was stained by the blood of the prophets and of Christ and lived in the squalor of sin and wickedness? For this reason the younger one grabbed onto his heel, since the younger people would mysteriously surpass the older. This is in fact “a perverse and adulterous generation,” according to the truthful voice of the Gospel, that “kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to them.” In the last days they did not fear to raise their impious hands against the heir, killing the Son of God. … The other people are the Philistines, whose name means “double ruin” and symbolizes the people of the nations, contaminated by both idolatry and perverse conduct and thus making themselves hateful, since in error they have strayed far from the way of truth. The third is then the assembly of heretics, the foolish people living at Shechem, in the sides of the mountain and in discomfort, because, writing and teaching perverse things every day, they foolishly waste their effort. The fact that they are not even considered a people shows that heretics do not have a single origin or a single error but have arisen in many different places and fallen into many errors. And they even contradict each other.\n"

When he says that he sought wisdom before his youth, before the opportune time to ask, he shows to have desired it prior to the errors of childhood and adolescence, and even before his youth, and to have asked insistently that God would give it to him, promising to seek it always. Adolescence and youth are fraught with dangers, because the actions of the exterior person2 dominate, as Solomon says in the book of Proverbs, confessing that he does not know “the way of a youth in his adolescence,” and the prophet asks the Lord, “Do not recall the sins of my youth and of my ignorance.” For this reason philosophers, representing human life with the letter Y, assign the lefthand stroke to infancy and adolescence and the righthand stroke to the more mature age, when the intellect is more robust and rejects the earlier foolishness of the senses. In fact, this letter was first used by Pythagoras as an example of human life, in such a way that the bottom stroke, thinner than a comma, would indicate the uncertain condition of the earliest age, not yet given to either vice or virtue. The junction above it begins with adolescence, of which the right side is difficult but tends to a blessed life, and the left is easier but leads to perdition and death.\n"
